2017-05-02 09:49:00,infosys plans to hire 10000 us workers after trump targets outsourcing firms,,san franciscomumbai reuters  indiabased it services firm infosys ltd plans to hire 10000 us workers in the next two years and open four technology centers in the united states starting with a center this august in indiana the home state of us vice president mike pence the move comes as infosys and some of its indian peers such as tata consultancy services and wipro ltd have become political targets in the united states and have been accused of displacing us workers jobs by flying in foreigners on temporary visas to service us clients the it service firms  which advise large companies on tech issues and carry out a range of tasks for them from managing backend computing systems to highlevel programming  rely heavily on the h1b visa program which us president donald trump told federal agencies to review     other indian outsourcing firms have recruited in the united states but infosys is the first to give concrete hiring numbers and a timeline for its plans following trumps visa review the move marks a huge increase in us hiring by infosys in 2014 when vishal sikka became chief executive the firm had said it would hire 2000 people in the united states      in a telephone interview with reuters from indiana sikka said infosys had achieved that goal and now wanted to hire us workers in fields such as artificial intelligence cloud and big data  the reality is bringing in local talent and mixing that with the best of global talent in the times we are living in and the times were entering is the right thing to do said sikka he said the timing of the decision was not related to the visa review the company started active talks with indiana in late february deputy chief operating officer ravi kumar told reporters in indiana more and more as we look at the future we have to decrease the dependency on visas sikka told cnbc earlier on tuesday that is something we have been working on for the last two and a half years the 10000 new us jobs will form a small part of infosys overall workforce of over 200000  infosys did not give details on specific jobs it would bring to the united states but said it would seek experienced tech professionals and recent graduates from universities and community colleges   kumar said some of the indiana jobs would likely come from nearby universities such as notre dame and ball state and would chiefly serve the companys us manufacturing pharmaceutical and life sciences clients in the united states    infosys did not say where the other three tech centers would be located  fewer h1bs last month two industry sources told reuters that infosys was applying for just under 1000 h1b visas this year one of the sources said that was down from about 6500 applications in 2016 and some 9000 in 2015 indian it service firms which typically flood the lottery system each year with thousands of applications have been among the largest h1b recipients annually us politicians accuse it firms of paying workers only just enough to meet the minimum wage of 60000 a year required for the visa well below others in the us tech sector indian industry lobby group nasscom says the average salary paid by indian it service firms for h1b visa holders is about 82000 analysts said more us hirings would push up costs for indian it firms as they chase people with the right skills the supply of science technology engineering and mathematics skills is not that much in the us so to get the right talent they might have to pay higher salaries said phillipcapital analyst shyamal dhruve indian politicians and it industry heads have been lobbying us lawmakers and officials from the trump administration not to make drastic changes to visa rules as this could hurt indias 150 billion it service sector the four us hubs infosys plans would focus on technology and innovation as well as serve clients in financial services manufacturing healthcare retail and energy the firm said the first hub which would open in indiana in august was expected to create 2000 jobs by 2021 infosys said kumar said it would hire 500 of those people in the
