has delivered a tremendous amount of value especially in the us but the nature of that value delivery is changing dramatically just as in the past it was easier and it was possible to move jobs to india or to companies where large amount of work would happen in india so these kind of a global delivery model or onsite offshore and so forthmore and more of the work can now be done with the

2015-08-05 22:30:00,sikkas first year ends with signs of progress for infosys,vishal sikka wants to focus on growth and hopes investments in automation and new technologies will take care of profitability and employee productivity,spanpcontent dividdivgptlineheight0fontsize0    when infosys last month announced its results for the quarter ended june 30 analysts were taken aback by the pace of revenue growth 124 per cent yearonyear and 7 per cent quarteronquarter for long the company was happy to be the most profitable company in its peer group now it seemed to have jettisoned that conservatism it was ready to sacrifice profitability for growth in the one year after he became the first nonpromoter ceo amp managing director of infosys vishal sikka is believed to have sown the seeds of change in the 34yearold companyhas he one year is hardly enough to overhaul a company especially in a sector where technologies become redundant every day analysts say early signs of change are visible though they would like to watch the performance for a few more quarters before passing judgement on sikkagoals achievedinstilling confidence in the workforce and boosting their moraleconsistent initiatives like techfocused acquisitionsgaining back the pace of revenue growthwhile some remainto show industryleading profitabilityto bring back  attrition to a comfortable levelto show steady growth in financial performance in the coming quartersto get back the industry bellwether statuswith infosys reporting its best quarterly revenue growth in the last 15 quarters it might be tempting to suggest that sikka has turned around the company and that infosys is set for a solid growth trajectory says thomas reuner managing director it outsourcing research hfs research however the road ahead will remain a bumpy one infosys has to manage its realignment with its peers to catch up with its peers the company has to continuously outperform

banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1target for growthafter he took over in august last year sikka said his target was to reach revenue of 20 billion by 2020 operating profit margin of 30 per cent and revenue per employee of 80000 the route to that target is clear in sikkas mind get back to industrylevel growth and then make investments in automation of services that will fatten the profit margin and raise turnover per employeeinvestors though would like to know whether higher profitability would follow faster growth at some point which may not be too far the company will be under pressure from investors to improve its profitabilityin order to address the declining profit during the juneended quarter ebitda margin was down 70 basis points year on year and 160 basis points quarter on quarter sikka has laid out a road map on how to use automation tools for repetitive work which would reduce the need for human intervention for that he is also looking to acquire technologiesbut there is a significant risk involved when one chooses to acquire such capabilities inorganically for example the automation and digital platforms like panaya or skava which infosys acquired earlier this year wont give significant revenue contribution on their own  the success of those acquisitions depends on how well the company is able to integrate these platforms in each of its service lines for improved efficiencywhen sikka took over infosys was already working towards automation and making its offerings more elastic what sikka has brought to the table is focus urgency and a relentless drive to turn infosys into a customercentric organisation says peter bendorsamuel founder amp ceo of everest group but he adds in the same breath till date the modest increase in growth the company has seen is attributable to better execution we have not yet seen significant results from the automation efforts though these take time to implement and bring to marketinfosys attributed the decline in margin in the juneended quarter to increased spending on automation newer initiatives and employee compensation but these expenses the company will have to incur if it wants to stay in sync with the shift that is happening in the technology buyers market some suggest infosys may have become more accommodating in pricing especially for commoditised services like application maintenance and support and for infrastructure management services where deal flow has become thinour first priority is to get revenue growth to reach the industry level and as we start investing in automation new services and renewing our existing set of services as the revenue per employee starts going up the margins will automatically go up infosys cfo rajiv bansal recently told business standardretaining employeesthe fly in the ointment is employee attrition despite all the employeefriendly initiatives sikka has introduced attrition continues to be high at infosys other than promotions and salary raises one of the key things that sikka has brought to the table is his ability to talk in the same language as the techies initiatives such as flexibility at the workplace  whether it is the use of social media or wearing formals  have to an extent helped win the confidence of employees but it still has a long way to go within that context sikka has given the employees a sense of pride as well as pointers for the direction of travel referenced by automation and artificial intelligence says reuner of hfs researchin the short term the last quarters performance of infosys has certainly ignited the expectations of investors that means the bigger challenge before sikka in the nearterm would be to continue to show steady growth momentum and even better the previous ones while the company has sounded optimism for the julyseptember quarter its the seasonally weak second half of the financial year when it will go through the real testssikka for his part looks confident i think that the initiatives that we have started since the beginning of my journey have been producing results in small but measurable ways over the last 1011 months the results were small in the beginning but they were clear these are still early results i would say but they are beginning to gain momentum and we are starting to see that sikka said during the earnings press conference last monthwords of praisethe infosys old guard shares his optimism there is a huge technology transformation happening in the marketplace which is disrupting every industry including it services being an outsider sikka is wellpositioned to change the status quo and make this transformation happen says v balakrishnan former cfo and board member who continues to own infosys stocka few days after sikka took over last august balakrishnan along with a few other investors including former cfo and hr head t v mohandas pai and d n prahalad had demanded a large and consistent share

banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1sikka we have three dimensions to the 2020 aspirations that i have laid out 20 billion in revenues 30 per cent in operating profit margins and 80000 in revenue per employee i actually believe given the adoption of software and ipled services in our workplace all three are achievable the 80000 revenue per employee is something that we will get through quite easily but the 30 per cent margin will be a more difficult thing to achieve based on the understanding that i have right now but it can change with time i feel given where we are headed the goal is certainly a desire that is viable we are working towards thatbansal a  lot of these initiatives require investments ahead of time otherwise you cant have revenue without investments ahead of time there is always a fine balance between the investments and the current revenue our first priority is to get back to industrylevel growth roads you have seen the return to industry level growth now the next thing is to make investments in automation of services that will fetch us better margins as we achieve the 80000 revenue per employee goal that vishal has laid out the 30 per cent margins will happen for that we have to make investments so the margins are to be looked at medium and longterm perspective than quartertoquarterin the quarter infosys time and material contracts revenue share seems to have risen at the cost of fixed price ones is it not something unusual when the company wants to position itself as a next generation services company where newer revenue models like fixed price should grow fasterbansal this split of revenue varies on quartertoquarter basis over a period of time our fixed price had actually grown up to 45 per cent it is also a mix of projects we are executing at any point of time and not something that we could measure on quartertoquarter basis well yes the clients are moving more towards managed services they want more for the costs that they are committing to so you will see more revenue coming from fixed projectswas the margin also got impacted negatively due to rise in visa costsbansal its not because of the visas the visa process usually happens in april so this is a cost typically all information technology it companies have factored in in the first quarter if you recall we had clearly stated that our margins would drop 5080 basis points this is in line with the expense structure with the first quarter gone by and the pyramid structure helping costs down you will see margins grow this is how the margins of any it services company will lookthe it services industry including infosys is overly focusing on digitisation but the size of the deals looks much smaller compared to multibillion dollar engagement the industry was executing traditionally is it not a big concernsikka the deals that you are seeing from our newer initiatives may look small but the impact on the others clients is huge you might to do 1 million or 05 million projects with one of the top 10 clients but it will instill such a confidence in them that the other stuff moves forward the result of the top 10 clients growing by 57 per cent in q1 fy16 is not because they are doing 20 new projects suddenly but continuation and innovation in these projects are instilling confidence in them to do more projectsduring your interactions with analysts you had said the second half of the year would be better than the first as you are expecting newer initiatives to show results do you stand by thatsikka historically in the second half the financial year which is october to march we perform worse than the first and this year we are being particularly cautious about that the initiatives we talked about would continue to pick steam so far we have seen a very strong growth in these areas even though the numbers are still quite small the strategic initiatives are starting to show up meaningfully in our performance as we go towards the second half of the financial year the impact of these would become bigger and bigger so we are cautiously optimistic and we are watching very carefully to see that the second half is not like the usual softness we see

to primaries ahead of the us presidential elections next year two of indias largest information technology it outsourcing services companies  infosys technologies and tata consultancy services  have come under the scanner of authorities in that country for alleged violation of visa rulesaccording to a new york times report the department of labour has opened an investigation against tcs and infosys for possible violations of rules for visas for foreign technology workers under contracts they held with an electric utility southern california edison this is based on the allegations that many of the 500odd technology workers laid off by southern california edison were made to train their replacements who were immigrants on temporary visas and brought in by these indian companiessenators richard durbin of illinois a democrat and jeff sessions of alabama a republican announced the investigation after these were notified by the department the report saidthis is perhaps the first time that both indian it services majors are likely to be probed together infosys had been investigated by the us authorities earlier too on allegation of abusing visa norms but the bengalurubased company had settled the issue with the us department by paying 34 million this settlement did not require the company to admit any wrongdoingrecently an american national and former employee of tcs had filed a lawsuit against the mumbaiheadquartered tcs in a california court alleging the company was biased in recruitment and allocation of work and favoured workers of indian

condition applications for extra scrutiny in this industry and we work closely to assist it in its activity in the ordinary course of our business we have received no indication of any broader investigation of infosys visa practicesin another statement tcs said it fully complied with the regulatory requirements in the us tcs maintains rigorous internal controls to ensure we are fully compliant with all regulatory requirements related to us immigration laws including those related to h1b visasaccording to poorvi chothani an immigration lawyer based out of mumbai the problems at tcs and infosys could have been triggered because of the government agency suspecting some wrongdoing or complaint from an employee unhappy or laid off or a complaint from any other interested party among other possibilitieswe often hear of disgruntled employees making complaints to the us department of labor or the us citizenship and immigration services alleging visa misuse defending an audit from a government agency in the us is a very expensive affair it requires dedicated company staff working on the cases and the huge costs involved cannot be estimated in advance given the man hours involved

dividdivgptlineheight0fontsize0    the appointment of vishal sikka as ceo amp md of infosys was itself considered a break from the past within eight months of assuming the role he has influenced the company to break away from the old mould in more ways than oneindustry experts believe sikka is seeking to underline an impression that infosys is no more a conservative indian company but a truly global one this has been reflected in the selection of teams engagement with external stakeholders including clients and breaking away from the practice of being the first in the sector to announce quarterly financialsever since sikka joined infosys at least 10 of his former colleagues at sap instrumental in building and managing key software products at the german software maker have joined the bengalurubased company experts feel that it is not because they were close to sikka but the company has done this to transform itself into a nextgeneration services player where products platforms and newer technologies backed by intellectual property are going to be pivotalsikka is clearly driving an agenda to position infosys at the forefront of the intellectual property wave of services what is impressive about him is that he is taking a consistent set of actions to infuse infosys with a new thinking and new leadership says peter bendorsamuel founder and ceo of everest group among the notable new hires who have joined infosys from sap are michael reh a former executive vp who is now heading infosyss wholly owned subsidiary edgeverve and core banking solution finacle abdul razack head of platforms navin budhiraja head of architecture and technology and ritika suri head of mergers amp acquisitions other senior leaders from sap who have joined infosys in recent days include gordon muehl who was earlier chief technology officer for security at sapmost recently former sap labs india managing director anirban dey joined the company to head the edge series of products part of edgeverve what is interesting is that most of them will be located in the us where sikka is currently basedin addition to the new leadership he appears to be shifting the companys headquarters to the silicon valley locating it at the heart of innovation and making it much easier to participate in the ecosystem there added bendorsamuel locating of leadership in the us closer to the companys major customers is in line with infosyss new strategy new and renew which is more about the customers than the company itself he addedthe decision of infosys to hold its board meeting in chennai this time is also a clear break from the old practice this is for the first time that infosys will announce its quarterly financial results outside karnataka though on two earlier occasions it had organised the same at mysuru where the company has a sprawling campus that houses its global training centre as well as delivery centre senior sources in the company say this is an experiment to hold similar meets at its other large development centres including pune and hyderabad which will motivate the employees to have greater bonding with the companyvishal continues to put his stamp on both organisational issues as well as the strategic direction said thomas reuner principal analyst for it services at londonheadquartered analyst firm ovumhe however said while people were overinterpreting the changing conventions and the break with certain traditions the crucial aspects for the company would be demonstrating the proof points of sikkas strategy and optimising the sales engine the acquisition of panaya was a statement of intent that automation and artificial intelligence are the key pillars to lead infosys back to its erstwhile glory the next step is to leverage this momentum and translate it into sales tractionwith sikka at the helm infosys has brought in many changes in its employee practices as well one of the first that sikka did away with was the rule on wearing neckties he encouraged the senior leadership to constantly stay engaged with the employees through initiatives like murmuration crowd sourcing of innovative ideas or even launching massive training programme for thousands of them on design thinking in partnership with the design school of stanford university the first acquisition under his leadership that of panaya was quite different from the ones that had been happening in the it services space in many ways  whether in terms of valuation or the purpose of acquisitionthere will be some murmurs but the question is is the company moving in the right direction and the answer is yes no one is questioning the ability of sikka he has put so much on stake that losing is not an option added another analyst on condition of anonymitychanging

the past three years the company maintained its fullyear revenue growth estimate of sevennine per cent infosys said its estimate was based on the currency exchange rate on september 30 last year this

currency movements but vishal sikka told me not to do so because we were in the information technology services business not in the business of forecasting currencyin such a volatile currency environment it is not wise to forecast we dont want to keep revising our guidance we have maintained it from april 2014 we believe it is right for the company to give a forecast and stick to it rather than revising it every quarterduring octoberdecember 2014 the euro the pound and the australian dollar depreciated six per cent five per cent and 78 per cent respectively against the us dollar high volatility in currency forced the company to change its guidance stance  fy15 revenue guidance is maintained at sevennine per cent growth in us dollars provided we assume the exchange rates of september 30 2014 we estimate at december 31 exchange rates this will translate to sixeight per cent growth in dollar terms barclays said in a note after infosys announced its earningsdespite the crosscurrency headwinds and seasonal weakness the companys operating profit margins expanded 60 basis points to 267 per cent on a sequential basis the company added 59 clients during the quarter including three large oneswe are excited by several breakthrough results in the third quarter our renew and new strategy is being received well by clients as well as by our ecosystem and we are

2015-01-01 22:30:00,sikkas plan for infosys defies the norm,his focus on design thinking and innovation as opposed to fixed practices has set analysts talking the new ceo has six months to begin to deliver,spanpcontent dividdivgptlineheight0fontsize0    during his keynote address at the inaugural session at cebit india the local edition of the worlds largest it expo in november last year infosys ceo vishal sikka first expressed his disappointment with the indian it services industry he had spent a little over a hundred days at infosys then understanding the business and meeting clients when he said that the industry needed to take a better direction i was not deeply familiar with the services industry until recently sikka said i find all of us in the industry on a downward spiralcheaper manpower and currency arbitrage have been the unique selling proposition for the indian it services sector for decades now however sikka called these the depressing reality of the industry its like a treadmill of increasingly lower cost hiring people faster and faster from more and more mediocre places training people less and less putting them into job faster and faster i think that is a wrong direction sikka has often said that the industry needs to focus on innovation and automation to renew itselfanalysts attribute sikkas different thinking to the fact that he comes with the mindset of the software products industry he comes from a different background having served in a products company where innovation is highly sought after says sanchit vir gogia of greyhound research we believe that his intent of getting infosys to a different position is a positive step but is not perceived in the correct manner since infosys is a services companydocumentwritegoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdefineoutofpageslot6516239outofpage1x1desktopdivgptad14907712771980addservicegoogletagpubadsgoogletagpubadsenablesyncrenderinggoogletagenableservicesgoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdisplaydivgptad14907712771980var banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1still getting the hang of itgogia is reminded of a blogpost he had written in june before sikkas appointment was announced the analyst had said that infosys needed a leader who truly understands the evolving it services landscape to overcome its problems falling profitability and high employee turnover he had also said that the leader must understand the dna of infosys we believe sikka is still in a transition phase to win internal confidence and build the business for infosys gogia observessikkas background in the software products sector which works very differently from the traditional it services business was the first question that had been raised from all quarters when infosys announced him as its ceo in june 2014 however most analysts and experts were eager to give him a chance considering sikkas illustrious achievements in his role as the chief technology officer of sap the german enterprise solution majorwhile the stanfordeducated technocrats ideas of design thinking and innovation have so far made several observers hopeful that he may bring fresh impetus to the slowing growth in the it service sector a few analysts have now begun to say they are quite unsure that will happen additionally some of sikkas recent statements have got several experts talking in reply to constant questioning about the nittygritties of infosys performance at an analyst meet earlier this month sikka said good things in life do not come in templates even as analysts accepted the reply at that time some later observed that working outside of templates might sound exciting for other industries but its the fixed processes and set practices that have helped the it services industry reach its current size of 118 billionanother analyst observes that sikkas ideas would have excited him had infosys been a 500million company what he is saying could be very challenging to implement at the companys current size and scale it could well disrupt the companys current harmony says a mumbaibased analyst who had attended infosys meet at its pune campus requesting anonymity it is still a big risk adds another analyst who has been tracking the company closely during the analyst meet sikka shared several ambitious plans and ideas but in some ways he did not answer any question directly maybe he has the answers to all those questions but does not want to bring much focus to them but there is also a possibility that he does not know the answers at all after all he is very new to the it services businessthe way to goin a blogpost greeting the 160000 or so employees of infosys for the new year sikka yet again chose a rather unexpected path and suggested new habits and behaviour which if implemented might make 2015 a year to remember for the company while several other ceos of traditional it services companies would have talked about things like utilisation client spending and hiring sikka asked employees to be mindful and curious to speak up and to learn and teach he urged them to ask questions challenge norms and review practicesadditionally at a time when most it services ceos are focused on ensuring that their companies get the largest pie of clients budgets for the coming year sikka set a different tone in an interview with phil fersht ceo of global advisory analyst firm hfs research he said the biggest challenge for infosys in 2015 would be to bring about a cultural shift and there was the need to transform ourselves culturally and operationally into a company driven by innovation driven by delivering much more value addition more innovative services to achieve this he said the company will need a serious change in mindset  in its offerings as well as in its operational processeswhile sikka has time and again made it amply clear that infosys will continue to be a services company he has said that software will play a big role in the companys functioning going forward changing a machine is easy but changing a human being is a totally different thing but i guess we will all have to wait and watch for now says an analyst despite these doubts most analysts have chosen to be patient with sikka and are willing to give him six more months before passing

this question in his book gurus of chaos modern indias money masters published by bs books and bloomsbury this is the concluding part of a twopart series excerpted from the chapter simple rules for successful investing of the book that explains the unique philosophies that power investment strategies of expertslets take the example of infosys the large it services company surely i hear you say given the amount that has been written on this sector by now the it services business is easy to understandthe vendor finds corporate customers in the west and then uses talented but lowcost programmers in india to write applications for these corporations the vendor then installs this application in the offices of the western company and gets paid a recurring amount as development and maintenance fees for its services on an hourly basis and on rare occasions an upfront license

banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1the reality of the infosys business is very differentonly a third of the companys revenues are from the sort of application development and maintenance adm mentioned in the previous paragraph the other third of its revenues arise from consulting and system integration while functions such as testing 9 per cent of revenues remote infrastructure management 7 per cent bpo 6 per cent and products 5 per cent account for the restonly 70 per cent of infosys employees are in india the rest are spread around the world with major development centres in us latin america australia china uk and western european countries furthermore with increasing focus on local employment by western economies it services companies need to increase the proportion of local staff in their customer locations overseasa significant percentage of its revenues 43 per cent are now from fixed price contracts where revenues have a weaker correlation with employee headcount compared to time and material contracts where there is a direct correlation between revenues and headcount indeed there has been rising demand for outcome based pricing where the vendor is rewarded based on savings generated for the clients furthermore around 5 per cent of infosys revenues come from nonlinear products platform and solutions businesses all these developments indicate that indian it outsourcing is no longer just a body shopping businesshistorically agreements in the it business allowed vendors to pass on the compensation paid to their staff for cost of living adjustments cola to the customer however as the it services industry matured the balance of power shifted towards the customers as a result nowadays customers simply do not want to countenance colarelated price hikes this impacts the it vendors margins since the vendor can no longer pass on the higher cost of wages to the customer andthe only way to deal with such margin pressure is for firms like infosys to become far more focused on costsemerging technologies that have powered a slew of interactive tools and products social networks media big dataanalytics and cloud computing are disrupting the traditional it services business model the conventional license model is transitioning into a payasyouuse model that implies smaller contract sizes for it services firms in light of these changes to the it services business the three critical value levers for infosys therefore have becomesolutions led approach given that the old business of providing application development and maintenance adm business through skilled resources at low cost has become commonplace providing solutions as opposed to providing programming talent becomes the key to remaining competitivefocus more on cost efficiencies as mentioned above infosys customers have become far more price sensitive than they were say five years ago as a result the firm has to stay focused on managing costs by sharing resources across projects and across verticals by using justintimehiring by consolidating offices and by using automation ie replacing programmers with software which can be used to write softwarebuilding for social mobile analytics and cloud based services smac the precise size of the smac opportunity might be hard to gauge given the pervasive influence of these innovations on our lives but it is clear that more and more it services solutions will have to focus on emerging technologies infosys too needs to invest in developing these capabilities  either organically or inorganically to create future drivers of growththese two case studies  ttk prestige and infosys  help illustrate that the ability of a firm to add value in the context of the world around it is at the core of its ability to generate high roces and hence central to its ability to reward its shareholders over the past decade in a relatively stable industrykitchenwarettk prestige has innovated systematically and by and large successfully to create a thriving business with roces close to 30 per centin contrast in a relatively dynamic industry  it services  infosys has struggled to adjust to the changes taking place in what its customers want how they want it and how much they are willing to pay for it as a result infosys value levers focus on solutions focus on costs and build for smac are largely the recipe for it to cope with a changing market whereas ttk prestiges value levers product innovation distribution amp supply chain management top quality management are the core drivers of its success over the past decade the trick therefore is to understand how many different types of products a company manufactures how it manufactures them and how it sells them associated with this is a flow of cash  from the time the company buys raw materials to the time the goods leave its factory and until the point the company receives payment from its customer understanding this processhow a company generates cash and then reinvests it to generate even more cash  is at the heart of understanding a business model successful investors refuse to consider investing in companies where they cannot understand this process relatively easilythe author who is head of institutional equities at ambit has been nominated the number 1 strategist in india in 2014

by a whisker tata consultancy services tcs in recent times the darling of the stock market was punished by investors on friday so with hcl technologies which delivered numbers below expectationswhile infosys numbers were ahead of expectations tcs and hcl technologies steady performers in recent years could not impress the street on many countshcl technologies which announced its numbers on friday reported a 32 per cent rise in the net profit at rs 1873 crore however the net profit grew 21 per cent sequentially much below market expectations the revenues at rs 8735 crore saw a 10 per cent yearonyear growth and a 37 per cent sequential expansionanother negative surprise in hcls numbers was the decline in the margin by 40 basis points to 214 per cent the company attributed it to the currency fluctuations and higher expenses on account of wage risehcls results were below estimates revenues disappointed with a constant currency growth of 32 per cent ebitda earnings before interest depreciation taxes and amortisation margins also came in slightly below expectations said dipen shah head private client group research at kotak securities the constant currency growth has moderated in the past few quarters and overall revenue growth has come in largely on ims infrastructure management services the company needs to improve growth rates in nonims businesses he said in a notefor the quarter while infosys has been able to perform largely in line with the expectations tcs fell short of consensus revenue estimates by 2025 million which the management attributed to continued softness in the insurance vertical and slowerthanexpected rampups in the retail vertical however its sequential revenue growth of 77 per cent was much higher compared to infosys 45 per cent and hcls 37 per centtcs revenues came on the back of strong volume growth increase in the number of manhours billed of 61 per cent these were three per cent for infosys and 32 per cent for hcltcs also

goyal and rishi iyer of citi research in their report indian it services take a breather positives priced in said the general improvement in the macroeconomic environment was not translating to revenue acceleration for it services this could be due to the commoditisation in some traditional it service linesthe most disappointing metrics in the case of infosys was the further increase in its employee attrition which peaked 201 per cent in the september quarter while tcs and hcl have largely managed to contain it during the quarter the attrition at hcl technologies was 16 per cent which the company said was largely stabletcs performance was not bad per se though it was softer than expectations i would say inflated expectations of the street 1819 per cent growth in fy15 look

executive officer jokes during a lunch he hosted for the media on his first day in office on august 1but sikka seems to have already found a way to control the aftereffects of all this pampering a colleague recounts his experience of finding himself far away from the office while discussing something with sikka thats because the ceo has this habit of walking for miles to work out a strategy often taking along colleagues with him i am now wiser infosys has a 170acre complex i would better have my walking shoes on before meeting him the colleague says with a

banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1shedding the flab however is the least of the challenges that the 47yearold phd in computer science from stanford university faces as he begins his innings as infosys first nonfounder ceo the real problem is getting infosys out of the widespread perception that it has lost its plot and is in a crisislike situation  something that forced nr narayana murthy to come back from retirement before handing over the baton to sikka though the numbers have improved somewhat the fact is that the 33yearold company has lost its bellwether status to tata consultancy services in the last couple of years worse it has been overtaken in profit and revenue by cognizant and even hcl technologies is giving it a hot chase for 201415 infosys revenue guidance is much below that of industry body nasscoms infosys employee attrition hit a record high of 195 per cent in the apriljune quarter of 201415 and the company has lost more than 10 senior executives in the last one yearthe other question of course is how the 160000 infoscions especially the senior and middlelevel employees would react to the transition to an outsider ceo will investors continue to have patience with the new management for long the man himself is trying his best to play down expectations by saying infosys could do without the intense scrutiny the results that you see now are the results of activities that were done quarters or even in some cases years ago therefore no matter what we do now will be reflected on our results after a certain amount of time sikka saysothers agree about the challenge infosys faces in acceptance of the new ceo from a cultural perspective infosys is a deeply inwardly focused organisation and what sikka brings in is an outsider approach but that will be healthy for infosys as the new ceo will bring a fresh perspective and a customeroriented perspective says peter bendorsamuel founder amp ceo everest groupfocus back on employeessikka says he is deeply aware of the emotional attachment that many employees still have with the founders all of whom have left the organisation for the first time and his first task would be to assuage their concerns but he believes what andy grove the founder of intel sikka was once an intern at the chipmaker once said about founders of iconic companies founders instincts should be institutionalised through processesthats easier said than done as the old instincts are still strong for example one of the first few things he did even before taking charge was to reach out to seniorlevel employees and ask them to show him the best software codes they have written while he wanted to have a firsthand experience of the kind of work infosys did in the past his move had an opposite effect many of the employees reached out to their friends and former colleagues and even recruitment firms assuming that perhaps their days are numbered it took lengthy discussions before employees were convinced about the real reasoninfosys thus has big plans for employee engagement to make a break from the overhang of the largerthanlife presence of the founders srikantan moorthy hr head of infosys says sikkas endearing personality would help break the ice faster but sikka obviously wants a more tangible demonstration effect and that is why the company has started an initiative called murmuration to crowdsource ideas from all employees in significant areas of operation murmuration is a word used to describe a flock of starlings a species of birds that is highly social  hence the relevance to crowdsourcing the idea has worked as 2400 substantive ideas have already come in which sikka and praveen rao the chief operating officer would personally look ati believe in rabindranath tagores servantleader model no one man can have monopoly over innovation anymore sikka says he is also engaging with the employees quite vigorously through townhall meetings and blogs and wants to take classes regularly  both the online and physical versionsthe ceo as a brandhis global brand equity is perhaps the greatest thing sikka has brought in apart from his intellectual prowess he is known in the csuites of all leading global companies and when he talks people all over the world take him seriously he would have to become a visible standard bearer for the infosys brand something that the indian it services companies need at the level of maturity they are at longtime infosys watchers saymany experts agree that what infosys actually needed was not a ceo who is a master sales person but someone who has a strong brand recall and in all these categories sikka supersedes many of his counterparts in indian companies the management change at infosys signifies many things says harish bijoor a wellknown brand and business strategy specialist one of the big things is the fact that infosys is moving on to become a silicon valleybased leadership from the earlier bangalore club he saysbesides infosys has brilliantly revived the earlier ceocoo model while rao an infosys veteran would be his secondincommand and would manage the daytoday operations and manage the show in his absence sikka would himself focus on americas and europe which account for 90 per cent of the software majors revenue he would of course spend a week every month in india according to sudin apte ceo and research director of advisory firm offshore insights the new model under sikka may gradually evolve like the nandan ceo  kris coo format wherein all the delivery and sales organisation will report to the coo sikka will be the external face to clients will make infosys visible at various avenues and platforms create its thought leader image and will be expected to work as a rainmaker to get the deals inflow apte saysintellectual property all the waywhile these are still early days and the new leadership will take some time to frame out the specifics of its new strategy one thing is crystal clear sikka is not going to change the founders focus upside down rather he would focus more on products platforms and intellectual property ip creation many people ask me are you going to help infosys into becoming a product company they miss the point we will continue to be a services company but bring in the efficiency of intellectual property into services business says sikkait is not a particularly new strategy for indias second largest it services provider infosys 30 this is the second year of the implementation of that strategy was primarily aimed at growing the nonlinear revenue stream and position the company away from the commoditised services but the plan could not click due to the changing requirements of the clients on the back of the global slowdown in spending that was the reason why one of the first things murthy did after returning to the company as the executive chairman in june last year was to bring back focus on the companys bread and butter application development and maintenance business a lowhanging fruit which is primarily based on labour arbitrageeverests bendorsamuel however says sikkas appointment is a clear indication that infosys will go back to its emphasis on ip instead of just labour arbitrageled businesses given his pedigree the ip space would certainly drive growth and profitability going forward he sayssikka doesnt disagree with that view he clearly has plans that are radically different from the way infosys ran all this while and if implemented this is going to fundamentally change the way indian it services companies serve the clients to start with sikka has serious reservations about the whole concept of staff augmentation wherein clients hire resources from service providers to do the work their existing team has been doing but the very fabric of that business has been laid on cost saving to me its very depressing for it companies to say we will do whatever you were doing but more cheaply i think its about doing more than what was being done before  bringing more to it being innovative sikka saysfor example he wants to focus more on staff amplification whereby endusers clients become more powerful and can do more what they are capable of he talks about the huge opportunities in oil and gas retail and automobiles think about the number of car breakdowns all over the world he says they are an expensive proposition as you have to call the mechanic get it repaired and waste a lot of time thats a huge opportunity as we can help clients by offering predictive maintenance solutionsthere is more infosys as a part of its infrastructure management services practice runs the infrastructure of hundreds of clients and because of this the company has deep insights into the clients business we can give them feedback like hey if you did this or that you would improve things by this much thats the opportunity i see sikka saystraditionally the it services industry is overly focused on utilisation of employees or what per cent of their overall employees are engaged in some productive billable works in a quarter sikka wants to change this disproportionate focus and use the bench for more training and educationsarabjit kour nangra vicepresident research angel broking says sikkas focus is on four broad areas  delivering high operating margins to maintain infosys leadership in the sector actively managing and strengthening client relationships and put the unutilised cash on books to use by scouting for acquisitions provided the company to be acquired meets the required return on investments criteria that would be a great way of running infosys but everyone agrees at the end of the day investors and stakeholders would want sikka to live up to his name which literally means coin in hindi and he will be measured precisely by that  revenues  in the coming months in an organisation struggling to keep pace with the blistering growth of some of its

letter said the infosys board had been highly conservative in the past and a continuation of such extreme conservatism at the cost of destroying shareholders wealth is not in the best interest of the companywhile the founding team had demonstrated a consistent financial discipline which resulted in investor community not pursuing this the buyback proposal aggressively with the board the letter said however with the change in management resulting in all the founding members departing from the company increased the concerns of shareholders and therefore there is an urgent need to consider and address this issue it addedthe three executives also said the return on equity of the company was consistently declining and the quality of earnings was also declining with close to 20 per cent of

perspective we believe the combination of the companys unprecedented cash levels robust net income growth and tremendous borrowing capacity being a zerodebt company provides more than enough cash for any necessary ongoing strategic investments for innovation or merger amp acquisitionbesides the companys strong cash position the letter cited other reasons such as its traditional belief in

2014-06-16 23:45:00,will the power of two fuel revival for infosys,it has brought back the old structure of shared responsibility between the ceo and the coo is it a recipe for disaster or a model that will spur growth,spanpcontent dividdivgptlineheight0fontsize0    call it a wise move or a calculated gamble but bangalorebased information technology major infosys is set on a new chapter in its history with the adoption of a model that supports two power centres under the chief executive officer ceo and the chief operating officer coo the ceocoo model is certainly not new to infosys  such a structure was in place till two years ago however this will be the first time that both officials are going to be men who did not play a role in the companys founding additionally while the ceo is a complete outsider the coo is a 28year veteran of infosyslooking at the credentials and expertise of vishal sikka incoming ceo of the company and ub pravin rao coo experts and industry leaders believe that this could prove a deadly combination provided the two get alongkavil ramachandran professor of family business and wealth management at the indian school of business compares the ceocoo model to a doubles game in tennis i think by opting for this model the infosys committee is making sure it is not taking any undue risk it is ensuring that there is one person who is aware of the business background to run the daytoday operations while the other gets acquainted with the companys value and culture he says however this is like a doubles game where the understanding between these two players has to be perfect and bereft of ego clashesdocumentwritegoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdefineoutofpageslot6516239outofpage1x1desktopdivgptad14907712771980addservicegoogletagpubadsgoogletagpubadsenablesyncrenderinggoogletagenableservicesgoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdisplaydivgptad14907712771980var banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1everyone is looking at how well the two men relate to each other as the new leaders of infosys i think the model that the company has chosen is good it is the implementation that we are worried about says sudin apte ceo and research director offshore insights sikka seems a ceo for the long term someone who is not yet ready to take on the responsibility of daytoday operations hence a strong coo will be running the show my concern is that those who formulated the model are all leaving this is a highstake modelthough the ceocoo model has delivered for infosys in the past the company is currently faced with some peculiar issues such as shrinking market share and declining profitability for the two top executives the task therefore is going to be a balancing act between transforming infosys from an it services company into a strategyled technology player and focusing on delivering quarteronquarter results even as sikka who will formally take over from incumbent ceo s d shibulal on august 1 is widely accepted as an ace technocrat several observers have concerns about the lack of exposure he has in it servicesthis is what is creating apprehension in the minds of investors and client sikka is a good choice considering it services are increasingly becoming softwaredriven or have softwarelike characteristics in the digital or smac social mobile analytics cloud age having been the chief technology officer at an innovative software firm sikka can probably appreciate the changing technology paradigm and articulate business models therein which is a positive says viju george in a j p morgan report however our concern is that sikka has been focused more on the research amp development or product development and has presumably not handled large profit and loss accounts or operations products platforms and solutions accounts for less than 6 per cent of infosyss revenues while 94 per cent is traditional it serviceswhile some observers feel that sikkas appointment will not hamper infosys recovery there are others who demur ramachandran belongs to the former category he says i think the fact that sikka has been given enough legroom to operate means he is clearly focused on strategy he may go in for inorganic growth considering the company has enough cash on its books these may be small in size but something which may become new businesses for infosys in the futurehowever george writes infosyss recovery might get delayed as sikka will take some time to understand infosys being an outsider he would likely take time to figure out infosyss issues its culture ways of working politics competitive landscape the onerous task of rebuilding a team  all of which will take time to show results given infosyss size we believe infosyss expected recovery to industrylevel revenue growth by fy16e will likely get pushed out further maybe to fy17e or even beyond all in all we believe

the optimism stems from the two new executives having been given mandates that align with their strengths sikka will be the clientfacing person with the responsibility to make infosys visible at

2014-06-02 00:35:00,a look back at narayana murthys first year in his second innings at infosys,experts advice to the sentiment driver think big act bolder,spanpcontent dividdivgptlineheight0fontsize0    a year ago when indias secondlargest information technology it services company infosys brought back iconic cofounder n r narayana murthy as executive chairman about two years after his retirement the decision was welcomed with much fanfaredespite a shrinking market share and declining profitability murthys return helped infosys get a double thumbsup from investors while the companys shares rose around five per cent in the first trade after the announcement of murthys return they surged nearly 30 per cent over the next three monthsa year later however the sentiment is not as upbeat despite the several initiatives murthy is taking at the company most experts believe he is unlikely to meet his target of bringing infosys back to its old glory within three years of his returncompared with peers tata consultancy services and wipros infosys stock has been a weak performer in the past 12 months while the infosys scrip rose around 29 per cent during the past year shares of tcs and wipro grew 44 per cent and 55 per cent respectivelyeven as infosys posted 115 per cent revenue growth in 201314 expanding at nearly double the pace in the previous year its performance lagged behind peers during the three quarters of 201314 that murthy was at the helm of affairs june 2013 to march 2014 infosys revenue growth averaged 48 per cent against 65 per cent for tata consultancy services 64 per cent for wipro and 63 per cent for cognizantadditionally the company shared a forcast of sevennine per cent revenue growth in 201415 way lower than nasscoms estimate of 1315 per cent for the indian it services sector and rival cognizants guidance of 165 per centinfosys is still not on track and many large customers are disappointed they believe murthys return has not brought the expected positive impulse says peter schumacher founder of germanybased value leadership groupthey see his threepronged agenda as tactical costfocused initiative that is skewed toward

banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1upon joining infosys in his second innings murthy initiated a threepronged strategy which included focus on cost rationalisation which he said would start yielding results in six18 months sales effectiveness which would take nine21 months to show results and delivery effectiveness benefits from which would be visible in 1824 monthsmurthy also immediately brought back focus on revenueaccretive traditional business it the breadandbutter for most large indian it services players infosys had ignored this to a great extend over the past three years as it implemented its ambitious infosys 30 strategyyou also have to take into account the time when murthy was at the companys helm of affairs when he was the ceo the market was evolving and the only thing you needed to do was improving your delivery says sudin apte ceo amp research director at offshore insights an it research firm it was during nandan nilekanis time that the company actually grew at a faster pace  that was a time when the industry was evolving even now all the things that murthy has done are oldstyle especially the costcutting measures infosys started cutting sales and marketing sampm expenses too as part of its sgampa selling general amp administrative expense what it does not realise is that sampm spent is investment for the futurethe magnitude of problems was perhaps much larger than what murthy had assessedin the months following his return as murthy started laying stress on meritocracy and initiated an organisational restructuring infosys saw exits of some of its top sales and delivery people among others the company saw resignations of board members ashok vemuri v balakrishnan and more recently b g srinivas the three were once seen as top contenders to become the ceo of infosys after incumbent s d shibulals retirement by january next year these exits analysts believe affected infosys businessthe company also saw exits at the middle and junior levels which resulted in attrition rate rising to an alltime high of 181 per cent in januarymarch 2014while murthy maintained most of the people who left the company were not contributing much experts and analysts advised cautionwe have always maintained that an individual person or personality cannot pull infosys out of its current situation unfortunately that is the only thing that has been hyped and focused at apte says the recent exits have hit employees morale a look at the attrition numbers shows this uncertainty always makes employees nervous clients are more concerned about delivery and quality any delay in delivery will affect client confidence and with higher attrition this becomes a concernanother concern that continued to weigh on the minds of investors was the presence of murthys son rohan who had joined the company with him as his executive assistant company observers continued to raise questions on rohan murtys role and authority at infosys with several proxy advisory firms criticising the decision to bring him on boardceo crisisas the top layer of leaders eroded and shibulal announced his intention to hang up his boots by january ahead of his scheduled superannuation in march 2015 immediate concerns about infosys shifted from growth revival to finding an appropriate leaderwhile many believe an obvious option was bringing in an effective outsider who could restart infosys engines and bring in some freshness the fear for the company known to give a fair chance to homegrown leaders is exit of more leaders who could be eying an opportunity to performi still think its not too late if a new leader is appointed soon and he is able to balance infosys can pull up apte says the biggest positive is that the company has been able to hold on to clients none has so far divorced from the company infosys may not be growing as fast as a tcs or a cognizant but it still has clientsaccording to sources the ceo search at infosys has reached its final stage now the company has shortlisted a few insiders with the help of evaluation specialist development dimensions international ddi and some outsiders with the assistance of multinational executive search firm egon zehnderexperts believe the company is likely to announce its next ceo within a few weeks a lot hinges on this ceo selection a wrong choice by the company can really turn investors away and lead everyone to lose hope of a revival says an analyst with a domestic brokerage house the company should announce its next ceo within the next two weeks i dont think murthy will delay the decision on this as the tolerance level of investors and employees is very fragile at present i think murthy understands this the market wont accept a prolonged ceo searchwill he wont heexperts believe murthy needs to take some stronger decisions to meet the threeyear target he has set for bringing infosys back to industryleading growth rates most say the target might not be met if he continues with the performance he has shown in the past 12 monthswith challenges like high attrition and a shift in client spending models it doesnt seem possible for infosys to return to its earlier growth levels in the next two years says manish bahl vicepresident at forrester research a lot will depend on murthys next moves if the company continues with its revival plan at the same pace the target wont be met murthy will have to take some bolder steps like acquisitions or decentralisation of powervalue leadership groups schumacher also believes murthys agenda is too narrow and inward focused it does not provide a compelling vision for the futureas a company with the intent to lead the industry infosys must set goals that are broader and connect to the passions of its employees and customers schumacher saysquoting from the letter that murthy sent to infosys employees asking them to think big and act bolder schumacher says murthy must change infosys more

banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1such an outburst from its own employees raises a number of questions on the workings of infosys nr narayana murthys return had seen the stock price shoot up from a low of rs 2350 to a high of rs 3835 within a year as the stock market had a lot of hope in murthys ability to revive the companys fortunes however on the fundamental level the change has not been dramatic  for the march 2014 ending quarter the company posted an 8 per cent revenue growth slower than 85 per cent posted in the previous quarter while its guidance continued to be nearly half that of what nasscom guided for the entire industryfirst clearly narayana murthys magic seems to be on the wane in infosys in his second innings after the board of directors of the company decided to call back murthy as the executive chairman of the company in june 2013 shibulal the current ceo of the company was more or less an acting ceo murthy has not been effective in turning the fortunes and who better to say this than infosys own employees  infosys has seen one of the highest attrition rates among the top it companies lower growth rates lead to no hikes in salaries which in turn meant employees jumping over to their competitors it was not only the new entrants who seek monetary growth every year and compare their salaries with their batch mates in other companies who left infosys for greener pastures but even the middle and senior level employees left the company after murthy took over bringing his son rohan murty along was probably the last straw for the senior management nonfounder members  the demand for nilekanis return comes as shibulal has announced an early retirement in january 2015 and there are talks that the board is looking at an outsider to take on the ceo post post narayana murthy the best growth years were seen during the nilekanis tenure against an average growth rate of 782 per cent between 1992 to 2002 for murthy nilekanis tenure saw a growth of 384 per cent between 20022007 while s gopalakrishnan in his tenure between 20072011 managed to grow the company at an annual rate of 182 per cent and shibulal since 2011 to 2014 has helped infosys grow at 205 per cent  however both murthy and nilekani led the company when the industry was growing at a scorching pace they were at the right place at the right time gopalakrishnan and shibulal were heading the organisation when the sector itself was struggling post the lehman crisis and global meltdown  having said that infosys the bellwether company in the it space was known for the speed at which it spotted opportunity and moulded itself to new opportunities shibulal has been blamed for not seeing the writing on the wall their competitors have grown at nearly twice the speed while infosys was still trying to find its footing  it is very likely that nilekani might also fail to identify opportunity and move the company forward in the same way as murthy failed to do so both are from the old school while the it sector has seen a complete change over the last decade the recent annual report highlights the woes of the management while murthy said that the current state of the company is due to lack of focus on its breadandbutter traditional it services gopalakrishnan confessed that the company underestimated the effects of the adoption of new technologies and the change in the business model  in other words the founder members are still locked in the old way of thinking will nilekani manage to change the fortunes of the company after a mixed track record as the head of the unique identification authority of india is the larger question  infosys like the congress party seems to be dependent on one set of individuals it is the founder members for the company while it is the gandhi family for the latter both desperately need to be revived with fresh ideas and enthusiasm while the congress party did not seem to learn anything from its drubbing in the elections and have gone back to the family for succour hopefully infosys and its employees will be able to think

2014-04-23 23:20:00,why the infosys buck shouldnt stop at shibulals table,his career was marked by more downs than ups but one thing shibulal cannot be faulted for is lack of ideas his plans had good intentions but they were illtimed,spanpcontent dividdivgptlineheight0fontsize0    infosys ceo amp md shibulal has decided to retire as his term comes to an end in march next year the company has started to look for his successor how will history view shibulals tenure at infosys that began in august 2011 in all probability it will be remembered as a period of turbulence it was in shibulals tenure when the bangalorebased company lost most of the things it was best known for in the information technology world its status as a bellwether its ability to predict the business accurately and its strong management team which was the envy of competitors would it be right to hold shibulal responsible for all thisan unqualified affirmative answer will be unfair to the man who has spent almost his entire adult life in a variety of roles in the company he cofounded more than 30 years ago he is like manmohan singh his hands were tied whereas the situation demanded speedy action says kris lakshmikanth chairman and managing director of headhunters india a toplevel executive search firm the outside world especially the investment community may not perceive him as a success but the steps he took when he came in like infosys 30 were in the right direction without that background you cant build the next level so to that extent he was ahead of the curve however certain things were not in his handsdocumentwritegoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdefineoutofpageslot6516239outofpage1x1desktopdivgptad14907712771980addservicegoogletagpubadsgoogletagpubadsenablesyncrenderinggoogletagenableservicesgoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdisplaydivgptad14907712771980var banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1turbulent timeswhen shibulal took over the reins of the company the industry was yet to come out of the global slowdown precipitated by the subprime crisis in the us companies across sectors had slashed their budgets and that broke the back of the infotech industry it was not that clients were not spending on infotech at all but it was only on runthebusiness operations this is lowvalue business and is profit margin dilutive  barely enough to sustain the business with steady revenue flow it was at this time that shibulal who had been scripting the whole infosys 30 strategy decided to roll it out in order to transform the company into a global consulting major in the same league as accenture capgemini and ibm almost everybody agrees that the intention was right but the timing was bad because hardly anybody was willing to spend on massive technological transformation which requires highend consulting workthe impact was visible to all infosys lost market share to rivals its profitability took a hit the company began to miss guidance quarter after quarter the morale of the employees reached alltime low the first time the company publicly acknowledged that things werent going well was in june last year when it recalled cofounder n r narayana murthy from retirement to take over as the executive chairman the investors were elated and the infosys scrip jumped over a third many saw it as a vote of noconfidence in shibulal some feel this is unfair he shibulal did try to bring product focus to the company says t r madan mohan managing partner at management consulting firm brown amp mohan with infosys 30 shibulal wanted to align the company more on productisation of services and benefit from the multiplier effect of consulting that has paid dividends says mohan as the consulting business has really grown under him during the last three yearsmohan says that shibulal got bogged down by the legacies of the previous regimes for a long time infosys had lots of layers which did not do much besides he did not have the benefit of benevolent markets says mohan perhaps the only area where he could have done better was execution which includes sales and accounts management he addsaccording to a senior analyst with a domestic brokerage firm shibulals performance should be looked at from two angles ideas and the ability to drive these ideas he had great ideas and introduced them to infosys we dont know of any other infosys ceo who suggested a shift in numbers like he did for example he set the target of getting 33 per cent revenues from products three years later we know that infosys missed that target but that in no way means that shibulal was bereft of ideas or that his ideas were wrong however whether he executed these ideas well enough or not can be questioned he addsmissing the growth buswhen shibulal took over from s gopalakrishnan now the executive vicechairman infosys like its peers was faced with slow demand in key markets while the green shoots of recovery were beginning to appear most companies remained cautiously optimistic over the next few quarters tata consultancy services and cognizant technologies shed all cautiousness and began to gain size at a rapid pace most observers feel infosys was slower off the block when compared to these two rivals as a result not only did infosys got overtaken by cognizant in revenues it also lost the distinction of being the infotech bellwether to tcsearly concerns of investors were visible in a letter brokerage firm clsa wrote to shibulal around nine months after he became the ceo having spoken to over 100 investors post infosys march 2012 results we noticed some rare frustration among the investor community on infosys recent financial performance nimish joshi of clsa wrote to shibulal on april 19 2012 my feeling from talking to infosys shareholders is that they have grown a bit impatient with this underperformance in the past few years that didnt help matters over the next several quarters infosys performance remained choppy with one or two exceptions in the recently ended quarter january to march 2014 infosys was the only one among the topfour indian infotech companies to report a decline in revenueshigh churnthere are other worries too at the end of the quarter infosys attrition rate touched an alltime high of 187 per cent perhaps the highest in the peer group industry observers believe much of that has to do with the way the company thinks somehow protect the margin even if the business is choppy employee dissatisfaction is directly linked with the annual increments which the company had to skip a couple of times in the last two to three years citing slow growth at the same time it needs to focus on improving productivity to protect margins shibulal alone cant be blamed for this  the instability in the top management also contributed to the high attrition however the churn at the top may have been precipitated by the fact that shibulal is the last among the cofounders to be the ceo of the company so it means his successor will be a professional either from within the company or from outside this led to many senior level exits including ceo prospects ashok vemuri and v balakrishnanas he prepares to leave the company shibulal firmly believes that he is leaving behind a much stronger infosys than what he had inherited from his predecessor gopalakrishnan he recounts several internal and external issues that plagued infosys way back in 2011 when he took over i think it is not as tough a time for the company as it was when i took over says shibulal we had trailing revenue growth because of the external environment clients facing challenges and transformation from infosys 20 to 30 we did not have enough visas a couple of litigations were in progress including the us justice departments investigation then there were regulatory challenges all these had an impact on the brandmuch of those problems says shibulal are behind it the growth rate has doubled yearonyear all the litigations and investigations have been settled the new strategy is engrained we have not lost a single client and the brand is intact says shibulal new challenges will always be there but when i look at things we are much stronger and younger todayworking in the shadow of murthythings at infosys had become so tough that the board of directors in june 2013 was compelled to invite cofounder nr narayana murthy as the executive chairman to bring the company back on track he agreed and brought son rohan along as his executive assistant there was a huge outcry as people saw it as a serious lapse in corporate governance but murthy got down to business quickly if sources are to be believed since murthys return the decisionmaking has moved into the chairmans office with the ceo more or less an acting head of the companyamid much speculation about his reduced role after murthys return earlier this month shibulal announced his intent to retire ahead of his superannuation in march 2015 shibulal however brushes aside any speculation over this decision saying this was to give clarity to the companys board of directors about his planssarojini damodaran shibulal age 59 education msc in physics from the university of kerala ms in computer science from boston university

2014-04-23 23:20:00,why the infosys buck shouldnt stop at shibulals table,his career was marked by more downs than ups but one thing shibulal cannot be faulted for is lack of ideas his plans had good intentions but they were illtimed,spanpcontent dividdivgptlineheight0fontsize0    infosys ceo amp md shibulal has decided to retire as his term comes to an end in march next year the company has started to look for his successor how will history view shibulals tenure at infosys that began in august 2011 in all probability it will be remembered as a period of turbulence it was in shibulals tenure when the bangalorebased company lost most of the things it was best known for in the information technology world its status as a bellwether its ability to predict the business accurately and its strong management team which was the envy of competitors would it be right to hold shibulal responsible for all thisan unqualified affirmative answer will be unfair to the man who has spent almost his entire adult life in a variety of roles in the company he cofounded more than 30 years ago he is like manmohan singh his hands were tied whereas the situation demanded speedy action says kris lakshmikanth chairman and managing director of headhunters india a toplevel executive search firm the outside world especially the investment community may not perceive him as a success but the steps he took when he came in like infosys 30 were in the right direction without that background you cant build the next level so to that extent he was ahead of the curve however certain things were not in his handsdocumentwritegoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdefineoutofpageslot6516239outofpage1x1desktopdivgptad14907712771980addservicegoogletagpubadsgoogletagpubadsenablesyncrenderinggoogletagenableservicesgoogletagcmdpushfunctiongoogletagdisplaydivgptad14907712771980var banheightarticlemiddlebanner iframeheightifbanheightdisplayconbanner1turbulent timeswhen shibulal took over the reins of the company the industry was yet to come out of the global slowdown precipitated by the subprime crisis in the us companies across sectors had slashed their budgets and that broke the back of the infotech industry it was not that clients were not spending on infotech at all but it was only on runthebusiness operations this is lowvalue business and is profit margin dilutive  barely enough to sustain the business with steady revenue flow it was at this time that shibulal who had been scripting the whole infosys 30 strategy decided to roll it out in order to transform the company into a global consulting major in the same league as accenture capgemini and ibm almost everybody agrees that the intention was right but the timing was bad because hardly anybody was willing to spend on massive technological transformation which requires highend consulting workthe impact was visible to all infosys lost market share to rivals its profitability took a hit the company began to miss guidance quarter after quarter the morale of the employees reached alltime low the first time the company publicly acknowledged that things werent going well was in june last year when it recalled cofounder n r narayana murthy from retirement to take over as the executive chairman the investors were elated and the infosys scrip jumped over a third many saw it as a vote of noconfidence in shibulal some feel this is unfair he shibulal did try to bring product focus to the company says t r madan mohan managing partner at management consulting firm brown amp mohan with infosys 30 shibulal wanted to align the company more on productisation of services and benefit from the multiplier effect of consulting that has paid dividends says mohan as the consulting business has really grown under him during the last three yearsmohan says that shibulal got bogged down by the legacies of the previous regimes for a long time infosys had lots of layers which did not do much besides he did not have the benefit of benevolent markets says mohan perhaps the only area where he could have done better was execution which includes sales and accounts management he addsaccording to a senior analyst with a domestic brokerage firm shibulals performance should be looked at from two angles ideas and the ability to drive these ideas he had great ideas and introduced them to infosys we dont know of any other infosys ceo who suggested a shift in numbers like he did for example he set the target of getting 33 per cent revenues from products three years later we know that infosys missed that target but that in no way means that shibulal was bereft of ideas or that his ideas were wrong however whether he executed these ideas well enough or not can be questioned he addsmissing the growth buswhen shibulal took over from s gopalakrishnan now the executive vicechairman infosys like its peers was faced with slow demand in key markets while the green shoots of recovery were beginning to appear most companies remained cautiously optimistic over the next few quarters tata consultancy services and cognizant technologies shed all cautiousness and began to gain size at a rapid pace most observers feel infosys was slower off the block when compared to these two rivals as a result not only did infosys got overtaken by cognizant in revenues it also lost the distinction of being the infotech bellwether to tcsearly concerns of investors were visible in a letter brokerage firm clsa wrote to shibulal around nine months after he became the ceo having spoken to over 100 investors post infosys march 2012 results we noticed some rare frustration among the investor community on infosys recent financial performance nimish joshi of clsa wrote to shibulal on april 19 2012 my feeling from talking to infosys shareholders is that they have grown a bit impatient with this underperformance in the past few years that didnt help matters over the next several quarters infosys performance remained choppy with one or two exceptions in the recently ended quarter january to march 2014 infosys was the only one among the topfour indian infotech companies to report a decline in revenueshigh churnthere are other worries too at the end of the quarter infosys attrition rate touched an alltime high of 187 per cent perhaps the highest in the peer group industry observers believe much of that has to do with the way the company thinks somehow protect the margin even if the business is choppy employee dissatisfaction is directly linked with the annual increments which the company had to skip a couple of times in the last two to three years citing slow growth at the same time it needs to focus on improving productivity to protect margins shibulal alone cant be blamed for this  the instability in the top management also contributed to the high attrition however the churn at the top may have been precipitated by the fact that shibulal is the last among the cofounders to be the ceo of the company so it means his successor will be a professional either from within the company or from outside this led to many senior level exits including ceo prospects ashok vemuri and v balakrishnanas he prepares to leave the company shibulal firmly believes that he is leaving behind a much stronger infosys than what he had inherited from his predecessor gopalakrishnan he recounts several internal and external issues that plagued infosys way back in 2011 when he took over i think it is not as tough a time for the company as it was when i took over says shibulal we had trailing revenue growth because of the external environment clients facing challenges and transformation from infosys 20 to 30 we did not have enough visas a couple of litigations were in progress including the us justice departments investigation then there were regulatory challenges all these had an impact on the brandmuch of those problems says shibulal are behind it the growth rate has doubled yearonyear all the litigations and investigations have been settled the new strategy is engrained we have not lost a single client and the brand is intact says shibulal new challenges will always be there but when i look at things we are much stronger and younger todayworking in the shadow of murthythings at infosys had become so tough that the board of directors in june 2013 was compelled to invite cofounder nr narayana murthy as the executive chairman to bring the company back on track he agreed and brought son rohan along as his executive assistant there was a huge outcry as people saw it as a serious lapse in corporate governance but murthy got down to business quickly if sources are to be believed since murthys return the decisionmaking has moved into the chairmans office with the ceo more or less an acting head of the companyamid much speculation about his reduced role after murthys return earlier this month shibulal announced his intent to retire ahead of his superannuation in march 2015 shibulal however brushes aside any speculation over this decision saying this was to give clarity to the companys board of directors about his planssarojini damodaran shibulal age 59 education msc in physics from the university of kerala ms in computer science from boston university
