2017-06-22 15:00:00,hcl infosys techm good stocks to buy for longterm investors nangra,were recommending largecap companies like hcl infosys at these valuations,  if i have got these numbers right because i have not heard the whole thing i think what they have said is exports are going to grow 68 per cent and domestic 10 to 11 per cent so the overall industry growth gets pegged in the 89 per cent range after infosys guidance i was not expecting any great guidance coming in because the bellwether companies have indicated much earlier that is the trend nasscom is a body which comprises industry leaders only so it cannot have a big difference i am not surprised by 89 per cent kind of growth that they have overall for the industry so i am not surprised to that extent actually   yes 89 per cent   that is what i said given what the industry majors were saying we were not surprised that we will be closer to that range   yes as you rightly pointed out every stock has to be valued from the perspective of what it offers so if i have to look at the concerns that the has visvis growth first then came in visa cost and other things so i guess growth of this industry would definitely be not similar to what it used to be  but i would say the base of the industry is also huge so if i have to adjust for the base i think it is doing perfectly fine given the tough macro environment this is pretty decent growth i would say and coming to the next part is the profitability there most of the it companies especially the top ones like tcs and have maintained profitability in a tough environment  coming down to valuation two parameters that one looks to value a business is roe and growth these are a cashrich companies with business roes of higher than 40 per cent and majority of their money is lying in cash on with growth being somewhere around close to say 78 per cent on a constant currency i think 40 roe and 8 growth obviously roe will be the determinant of attrition  a look at the valuation of most of the largecap it firms barring tcs like you have infosys at around 14 times probably hcl in the similar range so these are the very compelling valuations for the largecaps of the industry the market is not giving them enough weightage because investors are waiting for growth to come back to doubledigits  i think valuations are already in growth in double digits so that is factored in at this point we are definitely recommending largecap companies like hcl infosys even at these valuations so these are good to buy for longterm investors given that business roes are good and their growth is also decent cash generation is very strong and so are valuations,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/hcl-infosys-techm-good-stocks-to-buy-for-long-term-investors-nangra/articleshow/59268379.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:14:54

2017-06-14 14:00:00,infosys squabble calls for a theory of the teenage firm,it seems some founders of infosys are acting like teenagers in going after vishal sikka, four decades ago two university of rochester professors came up with a definitive theory for that awesome social invention known as a publicly held company the firm they said was but a series of contractual agreements between the owners and their agents  the managers  and there the matter rested until a 20f filing at the us securities exchange commission by bangalorebased reopened the contract and raised the question can agents ask pesky principals to get off the lawn  gadfly has argued that some founders of infosys long considered a bellwether of indias software exports were acting like teenagers in going after ceo and the board for everything from shifting values to the former sap se executives chartered flights and top managers pay  nr narayana murthy and three other founders own around 13 percent of the stock they no longer run infosys if they fear sikka will waste the companys 5 billion cash hoard on trophy acquisitions they should make a case for why higher dividends or more aggressive buybacks would be better  either sway the board by enlisting other shareholders or sell out thats what an activist like paul singers elliott management corp would do if the founders are feeling particularly bold they could even try a buyout and fire sikka and the board a whisper campaign in the press is unhelpful  that assessment holds but now it looks like infosys wants to compete with its founders in silliness take the 20f filing  actions of activist shareholders may adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic priorities and could impact the trading value of our securities responding to actions by activist shareholders can divert the attention of our board of directors management and our employees and disrupt our operations such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan this may also require us to incur significant legal fees and public relations costs the perceived uncertainties as to our future direction could affect client and investor sentiment resulting in volatility in the price of our securities  to see how twisted the logic is try replacing activist shareholders with words like whistleblowers accounting firms or the police companies dont go around whining about the cost of statutory audits or that of compliance with environment or immigration laws thats because the shareholders  the principals  expect nothing less  when bank ceos grumble about onerous capital requirements the agents are again acting as servants of shareholders because the latters dividends are at stake  however the essence of infosyss warning distills into you dear shareholder could be hurt by my trying to defend myself against one of your own thats preposterous  theres a marketplace for managers if the incumbents must spend a certain sum of money and time to protect themselves from attacks on their strategy or ethics shareholders can always find another bunch who could do it for less thats part of the contract that michael jensen and william meckling wrote about in 1976 it doesnt become a risk factor in 2017       infosys says its filing isnt directed at any one group of investors thats just pr spiel the truth is sikkas halo is fading the shares premium over the it index  in which infosys has a 25 percent weight  is heading back to where it was when he took up the job almost three years ago he has dropped his bold 20 billion revenue target and in media interviews his coo cant seem to decide whether shrinking client budgets also mean pricing pressure on infosys  if sikka is trying to deflect attention from the indian software industrys dwindling fortunes or his lackluster performance then highlighting activism as a risk is poor judgment professors jensen and meckling would disapprove   ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-squabble-calls-for-a-theory-of-the-teenage-firm/articleshow/59142261.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:15:07

2017-04-18 12:00:00,prefer an infosys and tech m to a tcs right now sandip agarwal edelweiss financial,as interest yields fall you should distribute more money to shareholders says agarwal,   as you would have seen that tcs never gives a guidance but they make qualitative comments and the qualitative comments will be similar to what has said i do not see a very big difference in the qualitative inputs which they give because i did not find any big negative comment even from infosys numbers although the guidance were 65 there could be a debate around that whether it is conservative or not conservative or realistic but i do not see tcs commentary materially different from what infosys gave in my view these are early days since the us recovery and we need to see honestly by first or second quarter over the last 2530 years whenever us recovery has happened the clients have gone and spent a lot of money on the technologies and there is a huge pent up demand at least in the bfsi because if you go and see not much money has been spent in last few years in that segment except for maintaining the day to day operations i honestly believe that if there is a recovery and if interest costs have gone up there margins will go up in that case the spends will definitely go up and biggest beneficiaries will all be front runners like infosys tcs cognizant    the margin range must be brought down a little bit because you are going to have headwinds from multiple avenues like the inr is also an issue and you have visas we do not know what will be the impact yet there is no serious news which has come but there is always a fear that something might happen on that front it will be more prudent to scale down the margin guidance a little bit and i do not think that will be a negative surprise it is more or less known in my view    yes i totally agree with you if you see the last almost three years now these issues have been bringing down the companies revenue and they have been impacting their good performance of other verticals and horizontals the company has called out these issues kind of bottoming out one quarter back also and we saw some reprieve from there but still they are hitting them in some way or in other way but i think yes if they make a commentary like we are totally behind this or they give a strong reiteration that we are totally behind it and whatever we are now seeing growth then it will be a big big thing big positive in my view but my sense is that they are not totally out of them and i think diligenta still will continue to give them pain so that is what my sense is    i will say two things here one positive and one negative on the positive side multiple things are happening this sector has realised that there are not too many good opportunities to acquire in the the prudent way is to distribute more money and in this business there is very low capex requirements if you do not do acquisitions as interest yields are falling you should distribute more and more money to the shareholders what will be the way that we do not know so that is a positive from the investors perspective  at the same time if i have to invest money in the it sector i will obviously prefer stocks where the earnings growth has a possibility to surpass the revenue growth because in case of tcs their biggest challenge is that they have such an excellent execution all through even when dealing with japan and latam their execution is the best one and because of that they do not have many margin levers left and that is the reason we saw last quarter also margins were okay but they are drifting towards the lower end of the guidance range the challenge is that whatever eps growth will come will be more or less similar to the revenue growth  but in case of infosys and i see a totally different story there the margins surprise could be much higher compared to the revenue so you will see probably a very high earnings growth compared to revenue growth and the valuation comfort is also there so i would play an infosys and tech mahindra in the sector visvis a tcs i will not be able to recommend right now on my ratings whether i will change or not because i have to see what they are saying what is the commentary what are the numbers and all that but broadly as of now infosys and tech m are the story where your earnings growth will be more than the revenue growth and multiples are quite comfortable as distribution of cash has gone up significantly for at least infosys    no one can rule out any kind of kneejerk reaction but i do not see a structural reaction because stocks have discounted much more than what can come negative in my view and people should go by numbers the h1b numbers are not at all material now every company has made a sincere effort in the last few years to increase the us workforce significantly i do not think that fundamentally there will be a big issue sentimental impact can be there for a couple of days but i do not see a structural issue i do not think that the numbers which people have built in or what has been built in already in the falling multiples the negative could be beyond that    so i would not comment on the it sector as such but i would say that selective plays like infosys and tech m will definitely be market performers or slightly better than that in my view obviously my view is for 12 months it is not a quarter view here onwards at these price levels both the stocks should do well,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/prefer-an-infosys-and-tech-m-to-a-tcs-right-now-sandip-agarwal-edelweiss-financial/articleshow/58236461.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08

and talking to investors,bengaluru  mumbai bedeviled by headwinds that are dragging down growth has moved to placate its promoters by appointing a cochairman to the board of the nasdaq listed company while also pointing to distractions which it said had contributed to a below par performance in the previous quarter  board member and former chairman of microsoft india will be the cochairman of the infosys board alongside r seshasayee even as talks continue with institutional investors and promoters to defuse the heated spat over allegations of poor governance at indias secondlargest software services company levelled by founder nr narayana murthy in february castigating the board for what he termed as falling standards of governance murthy had called for the appointment of new board members and also a cochairman acknowledging the impact of these demands on the information technology companys operations in the januarymarch quarter infosys chief executive officer said the atmosphere became tougher  the reality is that especially over the last quarter generally there have been distractions and noise we have to deal with this  indias 150billion outsourcing industry has been battling a series of challenges ranging from visa regulations to pressure on margins from increasing automation of it services  industry lobby nasscom has not yet given a growth target for fiscal 2018 citing macroeconomic uncertainty  infosys which disappointed investors due its tepid outlook for the year has faced extra pressure also due to the ongoing spat over its governance the attempt to alleviate the friction between management and promoters is also aimed at clearing management focus to deal with operational hurdles that lie ahead i am happy that the promoters feel comfortable about the decision taken r seshasayee chairman of infosys told et although he was at pains to clarify that ravis name did not come from the promoters  we dont need somebody else introducing ravi to the board he is a part of the board and so it is a natural choice said the 69yearold who was appointed to his post in 2015 the decision to bring in venkatesan is designed to increase the boards bandwidth and ensure the transformation journey we have charted out is completed as smoothly as possible seshasayee said murthy declined comment on the appointment  venkatesan who has served on the infosys board for over five years now and was part of the search process that identified and appointed sikka as chief executive officer of the company in 2014 said the division of roles between seshasayee and himself will be fluid he venkatesan would likely take the lead in matters of strategy while seshasayee would be responsible for governance and talking to investors  we have decided that we would have a working partnership for collaboration there is a very long set of things to focus on some of which is external and some internal on some of them he will take the lead while i play the supporting role in other things i will take more of a leadership role while he and other take the supporting role he said    experts are of the view that this unusual structure raises more questions than provide answers the role of the cochairman needs to be defined in this situation we know the chairman calls the meetings and is responsible for governance but what would the cochairman do said shriram subramanian managing director of shareholder advisory firm ingovern   other company watchers doubt whether these moves will lead to a cooling of tempers and also address the charges of flawed governance  we had asked for the chairman to step down so the investigations into the governance actions could be taken by someone independent said v balakrishnan former infosys executive and vocal critic of the management i do not see how this cochairman improves the governance he said  murthy in an exclusive interview to et had questioned the decision by the company to pay a hefty severance package to former chief financial officer rajiv bansal holding seshasayee and remuneration committee head jeffrey lehman responsible  while infosys has appointed cyril amarchand mangaldas to create a framework for its interactions with key stakeholders and governance the board has already been meeting investors  the engagement with the investors is something that we have already started we have been talking to key investor groups to get their inputs on various matters relating to the composition of the board and the like seshasayee said he added that the companys institutional investors had not raised concerns about governance but were keen that the issues be sorted out as quickly as possible  in addition to battling its irate founder infosys is also investigating a whistleblower letter sent in february the letter alleged irregularities in the acquisition of israeli technology startup panaya and conflicts of interest the board has brought in an independent outside firm to help with

2017-04-13 16:00:00,have not yet decided on quantum  timing of wage hikespravinrao cooinfosys,we have factored some amount of it but we have not yet decided the quantum,  what we have done is we have broaden the range right earlier it was 24 to 25 last year we have broaden the range if you look at last year when we give 24 to 25 it was on the back of cross currency it was back of pricing and growing trajectory but we still delivered at the higher end of that margin guidance which is 247 which is pretty much same as earlier year  that was possible primarily because of the laser sharp focus on operational efficiency whether it is utilisation whether it is subcon expenses whether it is onsite employee cost this year we have broaden the range 23 to 25 the reason for broadening is that we want to closely watch the how the moves because already the rupee has moved about 33 if you look at from fy17 average that is one factor to consider  the second factor is that we want to proactively make certain and onsite dc investments in the united states to address the any potential changes there so i think the range is broadened so we will certainly focus gain to what extent the rupee and to what extent this onsite investments we can mitigate is operational efficiency so it is just a broader range and eps is again factor of the revenue growth factor of operating margins so i am sure that we will certainly try to focus on how to optimise the operational efficiency and things like that so that is where we are   if we look at it in the last four quarters on an average we have been doing about 800 million tcb in every quarter so it is possible the only thing is that the deal sizes are coming down actually unlike in the past   yes pricing is obviously under pressure large deal wins lot of pressure on the pricing as well but it is possible if you look at the pipeline and other things and if you assume a normal course of deal closures it is possible to hit 1 billion so you are not giving up on that we are fairly comfortable because we have consistently now in the last one year we have been around 800 million it is a function of deal size deal closure and other things but it is doable   bfsi is looking up consulting as i said where our focus is more on getting the fundamentals right so we are not focussing too much on the growth we are focussing more on getting the basic right getting the profitability back and getting more consistency in the consulting outcomes so that is our focus here   the capital allocation policy clearly talks about two things right how much of future cash flow will be distributed which is 70 of free cash flow it also talks about out of the current cash on the balance sheet up to 2 billion in fiscal 2018 we are listed in multiple stock exchanges around the world in nyc euronext paris london and so on and so forth we are quite to comply with multiple regulatory requirements this is the plan that we have through a combination of both indicated dividend and our stock repurchases so once all these regulatory pieces that we need to look at the board will exactly announce the exact mechanism of that   we have factored some amount of it but we have not yet decided the quantum like last year we will probably stagger out the compensation increase that is what we did last year and again the focus will be increase differentiation amongst high performers and stuff like that but the exact quantum and when we will do we have not yet decided so as and when we decide we will announce it   there are multiple regulatory proposals in the united states and so on and so forth so it is very uncertain which one will be finally adopted etc what we have to do in preparation is really to ensure that we have onsite development centres where we have local hiring and also have client proximity centres so those are the investments so there are multiple regulatory proposals right and the trajectory of them which one will be taken which will be the final adoption it is too early to say   we do not give the breakout of this what we talk about is consulting and system integration csi that continues to be about 325 of our revenues on the digital we have not yet so far we have not given the breakup and this quarter we will start vishal said earlier in the other conference we will start looking at giving breakout of different parts of it new services new software and other things   if you look at this particular quarter the top client grew 68 quarter on quarter if you look at the quarterly there will always be volatility if you look at the top 25 clients they grew close to 4 year on year it is not really the way to look at it is two ways one to look at it is hey you do not want a very high concentration to issue of clients  the second way of looking at it is we need much more penetration of our top clients if you look at the number of 100 million clients we were about 12 about three years ago today we are 19 so we have a good penetration amongst our top clients the number of 100 million clients have increased from 12 to 19 at the same time quarterly there will always be

2017-04-13 15:00:00,challenges for tcs greater than infosys mahantesh sabarad sbi cap securities,not pessimistic or negative on infosys but this year it is going to be about banks all the way says sabarad,   the way we are seeing it is prima facie the guidance that they have given of 6585 for the year ahead is not materially different from what they have achieved for the last year and therefore from an investors point of view there seems to be no material trajectory upswing that one should look forward to  but having said that there is a slight difference in the way you look at the cagr rate that was achieved last year versus what they are going to achieve in the coming year given the background of the deal win figures that they had given so it does seem to suggest that the cagr growth will now start rising as we go later into the quarters and therefore we remain a little confident that the upper end of the guidance will be met and if the global conditions improve as is thought out to be then perhaps there could be a further upgrade in the guidance given  we are not so negative or pessimistic about the guidance given of course on the face of it the number seems low but we think as we go ahead into the year the upper end of the guidance will very likely be met with possible upgrade    one major difference between tcs and infosys is that there is a lot of uncertainty about the european operations of tcs there has been volatility in currencies as well there in the quarter gone by with now  the process of brexit having begun and the qe programme of the ecb is likely to be unwound later in the year the challenges for tcs are far more greater than that for infosys from that perspective tcs may have a subdued performance and they do not give guidance but the way the analysts would look at it is that they would factor in the lower numbers from the european operations    we are clearly very bullish about the banking sector the overall bfsi sector in fact and that stems from the fact that this will be a year where the problems will be solved most likely through the natural progression that we are seeing in terms of business uptick we have seen resumption of the credit growth cycle also we will have more capitalisation into the banks and generally we have the interest rates remaining benign  all these factors lend a great deal of support to the banking sector valuations are not too challenging and therefore we remain very bullish on the banking sector and you pick any bank the best way to pick a bank in such circumstances is not look at the asset side of the bank but to look at the liability side of the bank and see which bank is better capitalised and take a bet on that that is what we like  in the financial services space or the other nbfc kind of space we tend to weigh more and give more importance to such sectors as housing finance and microfinance institutions where we think the growth is going to be quite large relative to the other segments of the nbfc sector that is one big trend we are going to observe for the ahead it will be in a way banks all the way,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/challenges-for-tcs-greater-than-infosys-mahantesh-sabarad-sbi-cap-securities/articleshow/58163445.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:19:13

2017-04-13 10:00:00,infosys will regain strength going forward we have buy on it sarabjit kour nangra angel broking,the commentary from the management from vishal sikka has not been the most positive it clearly smells of pure caution says nangra,   see the range that the street was working with was somewhere between 79 per cent and the management has given a 6585 per cent guidance i do not think disappointment is that great because actually when the street said 79 per cent what they meant was last year has been bad you have a base and probably they expected that infosys will beat the expectations  the disappointment is that they have not beaten them in terms of what the street was expecting and secondly i need to understand the premises on which this guidance has been given before i can make out a call as to how the stock would react because prima facie what they have said is in line with whatever street has said  in terms of margins also they have mentioned around 2325 per cent now 25 per cent has been there on the upper band of their normal expected margins  to that extent again i need to understand what are the premises for that range to be given and obviously the sweetener has come in terms of buyback which even has announced now infosys is increasing the payout which was a demand from the shareholders for a long time  in totality the disappointment is more to do with what probably will come in after the management has spoken as to the assumptions they have put in for such numbers to be given to be more or less in line with what the street was expecting they have a conservative kind of a guidance coming just because of the fear in the macro which even the street has or it has an underlying long term significance  i guess that is the difference the stock will need to understand before it reacts and probably that will be more determinant of the stock movement rather than what has come in what has come in is more or less in line with a sweetener of a buyback and a     the commentary from the management from has not been the most positive it clearly smells of pure caution and he himself seems a little unclear on what the trajectory is going forward do you sense that there is going to be a fair amount of downgrade on the stock irrespective of the kneejerk reaction that we may see in just minutes from now after that do you see a lot of price targets cut as well coming in on infy or do you think now the negatives are all known and that dip could perhaps eventually in a day or two be bought into    that is what i said earlier  even if i price in a downgrade in earnings in fy18 because of margin pressures this stock is trading at around 15 times fy18 numbers which i do think given the business roes that the company enjoys and given the backdrop that they have decided to increase the payout ratio if the payout ratio of 40 per cent have to be increased to 70 then going forward definitely will increase and valuations at around 15 times was the kind of business roe that it companies are generating it is not very demanding given near term concerns longterm shareholders have to think from a longterm perspective i do not think there should be a very dip happening and that is the consensus that probably will emerge on the stock also we should not expect a major dip happening in the stock as it is marginally below what the street was expecting this stock will again regain its strength going forward    yes we have a buy recommendation on the stock,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-will-regain-strength-going-forward-we-have-buy-on-it-sarabjit-kour-nangra-angel-broking/articleshow/58159677.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:19:32

2017-04-13 11:00:00,guidance not enough infosys may tank 45 pankaj sharma,having two cochairmen and not having confidence in the current management team is very bad in my view says sharma,in a chat with pankaj sharma independent expert says if this year misses one or two quarters on even this guidance which is on the lower side it is going to be very very bad  edited excerpts     in the beginning i would expect that the stock should be down at least 45 per cent the 6585 per cent guidance considering the chequered recent history on guidance versus delivery does not look great if this year they miss one or two quarters on even this guidance which is on the lower side it is going to be very very bad but the 6585 per cent guidance apart from everything else is the most important number investors should be looking at and that does not look great    no this is the most important thing because having too many people in leadership position creates more issues than the synergies which you would be expecting so with two chairmen it probably means that even in the back of his mind mr sikka would not be very very sure how long this situation would continue or whether he would have the free hand to change and to steer infosys and that is something which is veryvery bad this is not a great time for the it industry and when the times are good probably you can manage with these sort of internal issues but this is not the time  infosys is really going to struggle with this kind of transition if you are not happy it is probably good to fire the current chairman and bring somebody back that is perfectly fine but having two cochairmen and not having confidence in the current management team is something which is very bad in my view    yes  both these sectors have not done that well but my worry about pharma is that in an environment when we are not very sure about how the would move the rupee has appreciated quite significantly in the last couple of months in that kind of an environment it is bad for both these sectors  pharma and it  which are very dependent on the overseas business but on a relative basis pharma is better than it because overall the dependence of it on what could happen in the us and the underlying business is the driver for these sectors comparatively pharma looks slightly better but whether i would be a buyer on these two sectors today is a very difficult call to take because domestic consumption based stories are probably still stronger and when you are seeing a lot of reforms a lot of political stability expectation that is something which is probably better for the story,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/guidance-not-enough-infosys-may-tank-4-5-pankaj-sharma-equirus-securities/articleshow/58159204.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:20:32

2017-04-05 14:00:00,media should ignore narayana murthy he should stop tarnishing infosys image anil singhvi ican investment,if murthy is putting the pressure on sikka to come out with a buyback i can agree but he should not belittle a great company he helped create says ican founder,    it is highly uncalled for he is making a mountain out of mole if we compare the hike in salary of with the industry peers it is not very high so i do not think he is making any valid point to say now that we always took very low salaries and all that is all humbug those were the different days and he had huge amount of in the company so it suited them to not to debit profit and loss account with high salaries but things have changed pravin is not a founder pravin is a professional who is being paid based on his professional competencies and what peer compensation packages would be this is a very uncalled for debate and mudslinging which mr murthy has unnecessarily got himself entangled in    i agree with you i think in india we have seen often times it is very difficult to say bye to a company which you have founded you always want to remain engaged with the company you can never say that i am moving on in life i am pained actually to see his email he has used i me and myself 23 times is this becoming of a leadership that you keep on talking about i did this i did that it was me it was my decision what is it where are we on this you have done your good job you are leaving legacy behind leave it and go ahead in life and look at many more things than engaging yourself into pravins salary why does he go on saying we do not like this kind of salary to be paid leave it to leave it to leave it to the company they will decide what has to be done you have done your job for almost close to 30 years you came back you were there for one year you again went back you again engaged in february you called truce and said i will not go into public and talk about it if there is any differences we will settle within then what happens just pravins salary has become a big issue for you to write a huge mail to the media and saying that i am not approving it this is completely highly unbecoming of a leader like mr narayana murthy i hope and pray wisdom will prevail and he will not again engage into these kind of things if he is putting the pressure on the company to come out with a buyback i can agree i am completely with mr narayana murthy on this if he wants to really force vishal and his team to go for a buyback but attacking pravins salary is uncalled for and a very ugly debate and mudslinging has started    only two points one and foremost is that he himself writes in his mail that this has nothing to do with pravin and then everything is about pravin what is it and the second point and is i blame media as well i request all of you to just ignore mr murthy you are paying too much of attention to mr murthys disruptive practices which is really belittling infosys which was an icon which really we all looked up to  so my request to media will be to ignore mr murthys mails mudslinging and tarnishing of infosyss image a company which he created it is like is his own daughter and why is he tarnishing the image of his own daughter,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/media-should-ignore-narayana-murthy-he-should-stop-tarnishing-infosys-image-anil-singhvi-ican-investment/articleshow/57984251.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:22:29

2017-03-09 16:00:00,bullish on mm confident on infosys daljeet singh kohli indianivesh,you should not be discarding dr reddys right now they are going through a bad phase over a period of time they will come out of that sats kohli,    right now we are pushing mahindra  mahindra we feel that the stock is undervalued and right now are not giving valuation because most of the time we tend to link mahindra  mahindra with only tractor business although they have been doing good business in the other segments also but tractor itself is coming up  so we did some study on what is the sensitivity when the tractor sales go up and down and we see that actually after many quarters the tractor business is now picking up and therefore the sensitivity of stock performance is very high on that side as of date that is our preferred pick amongst the larger ones mahindra  mahindra we are saying buy with a target of around rs 1700 i do not remember exactly the target but that is the kind of valuation we are looking at     no i do not think there is a reason to discard this stock they have been going through a bad patch but unfortunately this time there was a lot of expectation that they will do something better in this us fda audit which has not come around but that does not mean that ultimately you should understand the pedigree of this company and the kind of anda pipeline that they have  it is not that you should be discarding it right now yes they are going through a bad phase over a period of time they will come out of that and remember that this particular event of today has no financial impact on the company because in any case these three sites were already under warning letter so they are not producing there and the oncology formulation plant which has now got 13 observations has already shifted many of the products to other sites  it is only that the growth in the future gets slightly hampered and maybe it will take a little longer for them to resolve these things so sentimental impact is negative but we are keeping a hold rating on the stock and we maintain that hold rating    absolutely yes on infosys we have a buy call on tcs and wipro we have a hold call the main reason is that although all of them are now attractive in terms of valuations but we feel that infosys probably is moving ahead of others on this digitalisation and the theory about what is going to be done in 2020 they are more on that track and probably they have that capability to withstand this near term pressures also  while some of our peers have given sell calls and saying that they are most affected by h1b visas what we try to understand is that infosys is changing its model and going to cloud and digitisation artificial intelligence  all things that will take one oneandhalf years but then you are not paying very high amount at this time so it is a very undemanding valuation we have a buy rating on infosys on tcs and wipro we have kept a hold rating    one theme we are looking at is realty although we are not very fond of realty but we feel that the kind of noises we are hearing from all these developers that there is some pick up activity happening there so sunteck realty is one stock that we like we have a buy rating there and can see some spurt in next one year or so their projects are already completed so not too much of risk of execution and the new project they have done some presales  we are expecting some more pickup in those presales s 1520 upside can be expected from sunteck realty that is one stock i think we will be looking for    the other thing which we are looking for is some of these infra companies like kalpataru power and kec international where the thesis is that their consolidated balance sheets and profit and loss account will look better in next one year because their loss making subsidiaries have either arrested the loss or reduced the loss significantly and the core business is doing very well  so core business is coming from pgcil mainly the transmission business is doing very well so i think both these companies stand to gain in next one year we are expecting again good move from these two companies,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/bullish-on-mm-confident-on-infosys-daljeet-singh-kohli-indianivesh/articleshow/57555790.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:22:51
2017-02-23 16:00:00,infosys would be right to go for buyback sandip agarwal edelweiss,basically because the growth scenario is a little weaker now people are relating the buyback to growth but that is not the right thing to do says agarwal,    in my view buyback is the right thing to do and the extent of buyback which these companies are doing are broadly in line with the amount of cash that they generate and are actually slightly ahead of the dividend policy they were following  the new law on dividend treating more than 10 lakh dividend for an individual as taxable from that perspective this was a more efficient method i read it in a different way basically because the growth scenario is a little weaker now people are relating the buyback to growth i do not think that is the right thing to do the amount of cash basis generator is huge and this company have just slightly increased the cash distribution by this method so if they were giving 50 dividend this may mean 7580 but it is not like they are distributing the cash that is point number one  two if you see acquisitions none of the indian companies have a great history except for tech mahindra in case of satyam all other acquisitions have been dilutive and the acquisitions which are available in the are all lossmaking companies or something very expensive and so it does not make much sense to acquire them aggressively  all the acquisitions even for accenture or are all skillset based small ones so from that perspective also it makes much more sense to not go for big acquisitions you will never need this kind of money and if you see quarterly also you will anyway generate rs 3000 crore to rs 4000 crore again this has more to do with distribution policy rather than anything relating to growth growth will come back once the bfsi sector picks up which is very likely from next quarter onwards    pecking order on fundamental basis is infosys followed by tech and hcl tech our thesis is very simple in infosys and tech mahindra the eps growth could be much higher than the revenue growth while in case of hcl tech and the eps growth and revenue growth will be more or less similar we are maintaining this thesis for two years now and we strongly believe that the margin expansion story is only in two stocks  infosys and tech m if currency weakens then obviously everyone gets benefitted,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-would-be-right-to-go-for-buyback-sandip-agarwal-edelweiss/articleshow/57311816.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:22:58
2017-03-08 11:00:00,bullish on hcl tech  tech mahindra not infosys abhimanyu sofat iifl,one does not always need to look at the pe if your operating cash flow is quite good and growth continues giving a higher multiple for investors should not be a problem says sofat,    i would agree with you we believe that going forward the trigger for the sector has to be things like higher dividend payout as well as buyback because from the growth perspective volatility will continue to be there with challenges on h1b front today we heard about the dependence so there could be some curbs on that also so going forward if you look at the sector stocks like and hcl tech would be the kind of stocks that we will be more bullish in relation to something like an infosys    yes structurally concerns still remain in the sector we are still not sure what is going to happen with china going forward having said that between ferrous and nonferrous we will continue to be overweight relatively on the nonferrous side so we would be a bit overweight on stocks like hindalco and vedanta as you rightly said whenever a qip happens stocks do tend to go and correct from those levels but if you look at a twoyear view considering the operating leverage advantage that these companies are going to have we think these are the decent plays within the metal pack as of now    yes absolutely i personally have been going to the dmart store for more than a decade if you look at per square feet revenue that they do the same store sales growth that is happening there as well as more importantly the model at which they operate which is that they own the property and the payment cycle to the vendors is quite less and are able to do heavy discounting to the consumers so considering those kind of facts it is absolute buy and investors especially the retail investors should all go out and invest in this particular issue it is not that overvalued relative to what one would find a in 2008 it is a good opportunity for investors to enter the market    if you look at the current business they are just spread out in maharashtra gujarat and a little bit in karnataka the opportunity on the overall indian market is quite large for dmart relative to the kind of market cap they are getting there is still a lot of potential in retail  second one does not always need to look at the pe if your operating cash flow is quite good and growth continues giving a higher multiple for investors should not be a problem and we have seen that in the case of stocks especially in case of we have seen that in case of eicher if growth is good investor will continue to give you those kind of higher multiples    kotak is one of the best managed banks in india and with some kind of ma related stuff happening or more fund raising it is going to go stronger and stronger from a long term perspective so we continue to be bullish on the bank the business is doing well and that is another area where kotak has an edge over other banks so i think so it is a stock to hold for long term,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/bullish-on-hcl-tech-tech-mahindra-not-infosys-abhimanyu-sofat-iifl/articleshow/57531022.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:23:02

2017-02-24 15:00:00,we like infosys among it largecaps niit among midcaps sanjeev zarbade kotak securities,looking at the valuations which are at almost 17 times and considering the fact that there could be earnings downgrades we believe that one should be cautious at these levels says zarbade,  for the it sector 2016 has been quite an eventful year we saw happening in the middle of the year and then there was also the election of as the president of the us these were two important events and that also led to risks in terms of a immigration and h1b issues going into 20172018 we are looking hopefully at the it industry and of course there are risks relating to the compliance issues  coming to share buybacks we saw it happening with tcs and some other it majors also could opt for it given the fact that they have large cash surpluses that could be another factor which could support the stock prices and actually give a leg up to some so from a buyback point of view and also fundamentally we like among the largecaps and among the midcaps we like niit ltd   if you look at the trend in the over the 152 months the markets have generated around 910 per cent returns over this timeframe and that has been mainly in line with other emerging markets as well however from these levels we do not see any major trigger for the markets to go up further the earning season has been completed the numbers to some extent reflect a strong resilience to the impact of and that actually took the markets further higher  also the fii flows were better as compared to january however in terms of triggers the rbi has also indicated that they are changing their stance from accommodative to neutral and also there is risk of fed rate hike in the future so our stance at this level would be largely cautious and even looking at the valuations which are at almost 17 times and considering the fact that there could be earnings downgrades we believe that one should be cautious at these levels   just a clarification that we do not have active coverage in the telecom sector so i would not be able to share specific views on individual companies but would rather look at the telecom industry at large the telecom sector has an ebitda of around rs 25000 odd crore and significant debt on the balance sheet these are difficult times and for the industry and consolidation may be good for the time being but it is not really a panacea some of the balance sheet stress needs to come down we have concerns on some of these telecom stocks mainly because of the price competition and also because of the high leverage on the balance sheet   we are to some extent cautious on the cement sector because we have seen volumes really weakening in the december ending quarter as well as in the first month of this calendar year at the same time the valuations are pretty steep in cement sector so we believe that is the sector that could be avoided in the near term   the sector that i cover is the capital goods sector we are very positive on the stock called this company is into water treatment and sewerage water treatment over the last two years the company has got good order intake and as a result its order book has expanded to rs 7500 crore providing a revenue visibility of almost 25 years  now the stock has underperformed over the last two to three years the main issue with the company was that there were some execution issues the company also provided for damages on some of the projects we believe that the execution issue is now largely behind and from here on we expect good revenues as well as good ebitda margins to translate into good profits in the coming years so va tech wabag is one of our conviction picks at these levels,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/we-like-infosys-among-it-largecaps-niit-among-midcaps-sanjeev-zarbade-kotak-securities/articleshow/57325802.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:23:11

2017-02-20 16:00:00,i would sell tcs at this price but hold on to infosys sandip agarwal edelweiss,for a longterm holder tcs and infosys is a good bet but from a one year or six months perspective there is some uncertainty as well says agarwal,   the price which they have offered is extremely good no doubt about it it is at a significant premium we were expecting a 57 premium to current price but this is like almost 1520 which is a very good only thing is that it is just rs 16000 crore obviously the portion of buyback as a percentage will be a little lower maybe 3 to that extent there is a limited upside from that perspective but otherwise the price clearly shows the optimism of the management in the     as i said there are two ways to read this first of all i do not think there will be much impact on the eps so if you do a basic maths your other income will also get reduced to that extent now there could be some differences between the yield percentage you are assuming for other income but basic maths suggests that there will be no positive impact or negative impact on the eps it is more or less same similar number the premium which they had given which is substantial premium in my view it clearly suggests that the management is very optimistic about the business so that is a good thing in my view i do not think that obviously as of now we do not have details but i think the tata sons will also tender because otherwise their shareholding will go up and they are very close to the upper cap already so they will have to tender i think it is also a tax efficient way of returning cash to shareholders and this was expected but yes the price at which it has come is very positive    i cannot give this technical kind of view in my view fundamentally the stock is slightly expensive and also the environment is a little uncertain if you are getting such a good premium rs 2850 obviously you should tender your shares that is the way i see it but for a longterm investors who is willing to stay for three years five years there is a bfsi turnaround which is possible us economy is looking better these are always positive catalyst for indian it so for a longterm holder i would say that tcs and infosys is a good bet but from a one year or six months perspective i would say there is some uncertainty as well in the environment and the premium which tcs is offering is very high i would tender    yes if someone is not believing in the sector itself then it is a good exit but in my view infosys has significant margin levers and they can positively surprise on upside i would recommend a hold on infosys so for the time period people should hold on their positions they should not sell that is what my view is,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/i-would-sell-tcs-at-this-price-but-hold-on-to-infosys-sandip-agarwal-edelweiss/articleshow/57252559.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:23:50
2017-02-20 16:00:00,comparing hcl to infosys is like comparing apples to oranges roshni nadar malhotra hcl corporation,roshni nadar malhotra says that the only difference between hcl and them is the fact that hcl as well as wipro is largely controlled by a family,   no not at all    but we did that at that time we had also announced that it was those 56 million shares specifically for the shiv nadar foundation which we plough back into the foundation hence probably already sent so no plans at all and yes we are here to stay with hcl    the only difference between hcl and them is the fact that hcl as well as wipro is largely controlled by a family because the percentage is almost 60 and over so the structure is different it is like comparing apples to oranges we are all in the same businesses but the fundamentals structure of the ownership is very different    having said that if we just keep aside the issues which are coming up now there have always been leaders in the industry it is a very admirable companies with great people who worked in them founded them still continue to do and they are all there to stay everybody had just figured out the issue that is it    a lot a lot of time much more from promoter point of view but having said that hcl as well as if you look at tcs or infosys everybody has been around for almost 25 years and over in our case 40 years because we founded was founded first before so it is on autopilot as long as you are able to have a very robust board and a very good mechanism of people who are advising you on structures of people who are running it    i am the ceo of hcl corporation which is the private holding company so let us not confuse it with hcl technologies and hcl infosystems and really the strategic direction for hcl corporation going forward for many years to come is not just strengthening the position we have in the current technology companies but as you had asked me earlier as well that for the first time after 40 years we forayed into healthcare with hcl healthcare which is again a private company so it is not even a public listed company or we had looked at hcl talentcare with skill development as business to get into or there might be many more opportunities and avenues come too so with time hcl also takes on much of a structure and role as a conglomerate so if i were to just compare it to the tatas where they had multiple industries that they are in so as hcl also grows because it is a holding company and it is a family company and we do have a pretty large balance sheet which we can leverage for unique opportunities so i think that is really where one strategically sees it going,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/comparing-hcl-to-infosys-is-like-comparing-apples-to-oranges-roshni-nadar-malhotra-hcl-corporation/articleshow/57252351.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:24:20

2017-02-13 16:00:00,promoters vs professional managers are tata infosys victims of an ageold puzzle,in case of first generation entrepreneurs leaving control to professional managers is much more emotionally difficult for the promoters says pankaj sharma,executive powers with owners or professional managers  which one works better for investors is an old debate perhaps almost as old as the joint stock corporations  in fact when we go through the seventeenth and eighteenth century history of east india company we find many incidents when the employees of the company used to indulge in private trade and this used to be one of the primary reasons behind conflicts between the investors in london and the onground executives in india  it is a different case that since these employees were severely underpaid private trade was also permitted to some extent the history of east india company is also replete with numerous examples when the political involvement of company officials in local events was discouraged by the owners of the company but still the executives went ahead with the option serving their political inclinations in the most optimal manner  more than 200 years have passed since then and times may have surely changed but the debate continues more recently there have been events over the past six months in the corporate india where this issue is getting highlighted again and again  first the events unfolded at the and now when there are reports that all is not well between the board and the founders at   we think there are many investors who think that founders association with the venture beyond a point does more harm than good and things should be left to professional managers completely  this camp believes that after a point the founders become a burden on the company and an enhanced role for the capable insyncwithtime professional managers would serve everyone well  however when we go a little beyond there are many others who think a little differently on this subject this school of thought believes when ownership and executive powers are not aligned accountability suffers and the approach becomes extremely shortterm focused  this view supports the assertion that unlimited and unchecked power in the hands of people who do not have any longterm interest in the business could be very bad  it may be interesting that there are also situations when the board and the chief executive may not be on the same page especially when there are many socalled outsiders on the board  unfortunately there is no right or wrong answer here and likely this debate is unlikely to get settled ever  ultimately everyone including founders members of the promoter family professional managers and board members are human hope artificial intelligence is not taking away some of these roles  and ah humans are neither perfect nor completely devoid of emotions in fact the debate is not about what works better for the company or the investor  there are several stakeholders and they are not limited to investors they could be customers employees country society environment and many more and hence the situation gets even more complex the option in terms of what is good for everyone and keeps all the stakeholders happy may not even be there always  from the perspective of the investor community the most prevalent view is perhaps in favour of professional managers even if we keep aside the criticism that both investors and managers are only focused on the next quarterly earnings and are in the game only for a very short term there are enough examples where reckless managers have harmed investors much more than the damage they caused to anyone else  we think the choice also depends on at what stage of evolution you are as a country or as the corporate world  when we compare the situation in india now vs that 20 years back many smart promoters have realised that it doesnt make practical sense to get greedy in the short term as the personal wealth creation opportunity is much larger when you maintain better standards of corporate governance  another important observation we would want to highlight here is purely based on anecdotal experience we think in the case of first generation entrepreneurs leaving control to professional managers is much more emotionally difficult for the promoters  so once you know as an investor that the promoter is not at the top of his game it may be better to move on in the case of second generation promoters things are always better for investors when the promoters are flexible enough to give enough freedom to managers but do keep an eye on the broad direction that the company is taking  however there is one thing that remains unchanged forever dont bet on people reforming at least with the same person if not with the same company that is likely to leave you with disappointment and then you dont have anyone else to blame either  thanks much and enjoy your weekend

2017-02-10 11:00:00,governance issues will erode infosys value jn gupta former ed sebi,a corporate governance firm has been appointed which may prove to be very useful in the sense that if the board says nothing then it is a biased view says gupta,   first take is that any governance issue which is either there or which comes out in public domain causes erosion of i am sure such issues are certainly going to impact the value of the shareholder of infosys including its founders and including the current shareholders  the way forward would be to first evaluate whether these issues are really serious issues which matters or whether these are emotional issues the main issue that has been raised is regarding the severance pay we commentators do not know what were the compelling circumstances under which those severance package was okayed by the board now casting aspertions on the entire board that the decision was at the detriment of the company would be wrong to say unless and until we have the knowledge of entire thing  i have been reading about how mr murthy and other founders have raised issue of governance and transparency my first suggestion would be that since none of them are at the board why do they not take up a board position and discuss the issues and raise the issues first  secondly they appointed a corporate governance firm i agree that it may not be very useful but then it is useful in the sense that if the board says nothing then it is a biased view so if you get a third party view you get a better picture    infosys was known for its standard of governance and somehow or other this current episode has dented its image so the best thing would be to go ahead and engage with the shareholders who have raised issue and see to it that all the issues are settled but then the question comes who is right  both will lay claim to being right and and we really do not know who is right that is why a third party is an ideal solution to settle this issue because then nobody can blame that it was a biased anyway one thing is very clear if the disclosures have not been proper something has been hidden and then it is not up to the standard that has been set by infosys in the corporate governance i would say infosys has to reset its clock and come back to the same governance standard which it followed earlier,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/governance-issues-will-erode-infosys-value-jn-gupta-former-ed-sebi/articleshow/57076195.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:25:27
2017-02-10 10:00:00,investors would lap up infosys in case of correction dharmesh kant mosl,i personally have firm faith in mr narayana murthy and the great company which he has set up he would not let it go down so easily,   it is definitely a dampener because earlier we had the conflict within thetata group and now you have another stalwart like infosys following through  all this is coming into the play negatively so definitely a sentiment dampener but the stock price has corrected to a very large extent and i do not think from here valuation merits any correction in the further stock prices so even if there is a correction of maybe 5 7 10 that would be greedily and quickly bought into so rs 930940 is a very attractive and compelling valuation for infosys considering the type of cash they are sitting on and these things are going to be resolved very soon i personally have firm faith in mr and the great company which he has set up he would not let it go down so easily  as far as mr sikka is concerned he is a thorough professional and such kind of quitting and enough is enough kind of decision in a haste is unlikely from a person of his stature it does not put things in a good perspective so he should hold on the fort see everybody faces trouble times and such kind of things do happen but the person who stands out among all the troubled waters is the ultimate winner it is premature to say that he will take that stand but businesswise the entire it space is in a bit of a spot and that is the reason why we have seen such price corrections happening in the it space but valuation wise it has become all the more compelling so from trading perspective if there is a correction i would be a buyer in infosys and even if there is not a correction i am a buyer in infosys for around 10 stock    shortterm may take a breather but i think long term the market is in a firm trajectory because for we are expecting fy18 20 kind of eps growth fy19 23 kind of eps growth it is trading at around 175 times one year forward pe multiple which is 10 years average so plenty of room and scope for the market to get rerated if you ask me one top trading idea for fy18 it is sbi bank today whatever is the result just buy sbi bank and hold it it will give you phenomenal return in times to come,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/investors-would-lap-up-infosys-in-case-of-correction-dharmesh-kant-mosl/articleshow/57075184.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:25:35

2017-02-08 14:00:00,infosys founders raise concerns over governance should investors be worried,investors with a long term horizon may want to stay invested in the tech giant given the sound management practices and agility of the business model,et intelligence group the stock of came under pressure on wednesday following news reports of governance issues raised by its founding members it dropped by 1 per cent while the sp bse information index stayed flat compared with the previous days close  reports highlighted issues raised by the founders over the executive compensation which includes the annual salary of the ceo and severance packages given to the previous cfo and former general counsel david kennedy in addition there was a concern whether the company would be able to meet the steep growth vision set by the ceo in the next few years given the challenging environment  the stock has been facing selling pressure since its third quarter results declared on january 13 it has lost 4 per cent since then including wednesdays fall investors worried over the latest governance flag need to note that its severity doesnt seem to be high enough to overwhelm the current growth challenges for the sector and for infosys  infosys the countrys second largest software exporter reported single digit growth in the dollar denominated revenue in the past two consecutive fiscals given its performance so far in the first three quarters of fy17 wherein it clocked 83 per cent yearonyear growth and seasonal sluggishness in the fourth quarter the company may report a single digit growth yet again for the full fiscal this will be much lower than the growth rate of above 14 per cent until a few years ago  in the past the company had cited slowing traction in the large multiyear discretionary projects it had also reported delay in project ramp ups in august 2016 one of its significant clients rbs cancelled 300 million worth contract thereby affecting over 3000 employees  the current technology landscape is also prompting indian information technology it exporters to reconsider their traditional business models where the number of employees typically drove revenue growth to their credit these companies are gearing up to address the changing client requirements in the form of rising inclination towards new technologies such as automation mobility and cloud computing  the recent rising rhetoric against h1b visa usage in the us adds to the uncertainty a related bill presented in the house of representatives if passed will push employers including indian it companies such as infosys to increase local recruitment and raise salaries of h1b employees by more than double compared with the average pay  these factors appear to be far more daunting and require immediate attention by the company management and the board in comparison with the governance issues raised by the founders and as reported by news agencies  during results press conferences in the past few quarters sikka has mentioned achieving  20 billion revenue milestone by 2020 but more as an ambition or vision rather than as a financial target the concern of founding members whether this is achievable in the current tough scenario may be apt but there seems to be a consideration of only the organic route of growth behind such a concern  infosys had over  45 billion rs 30480 crore in cash equivalents and current investments at the end of december 2016 it can deploy a chunk of this money to grow revenue inorganically that is by acquiring high growth businesses  the other interesting part of sikkas vision is to report  80000 revenue per employee by 2020 compared with  50485 per employee in december 2016  this reflects the managements awareness about the diminishing utility of the erstwhile linear relationship between the size of the headcount and revenue growth due to rising importance of automation in addition the company does not want to part ways with high profitability while chasing growth sikka wants to push the operating margin ebit margin up to 30 by 2020 compared with 247 in the nine months to december 2016 this means even if the management scouts for inorganic growth the future profitability of the business to be acquired will be a critical factor in the decision making  investors with a long term horizon therefore may want to stay invested in infosys given the sound management practices agility of the business model and deeper in the client accounts,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/infosys-founders-raise-concerns-over-governance-should-investors-be-worried/articleshow/57036232.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:26:06

2017-02-08 11:00:00,infosys founders may be angling for a buyback sandip sabharwal,buyback is not a great idea where growth is stalling because buybacks make sense when the stock is cheap and growth is going to be good going forward says sabharwal,   one is that the stock is down to that extent the impact should be very less but the reality is that it does not augur well for the company in the short run i do not think this conflict will linger for very long because in my view the ceo and the management have a growth strategy and they are looking at some acquisitions  the promoters who have just 125 stake want to maintain their stake and also want some cash in hand so they may be gunning for a buyback that is where the conflict could be contrary to this compensation thing which is coming in the papers it is more than that and i do not think buyback is a great idea for a company where growth is stalling because you do buybacks when you think the stock is cheap and the growth is going to be good going forward right now they can use the cash to acquire capabilities for growth which they might be lacking    see buyback make sense as it means saying that we find that our stock is cheap and the buyback should be done at this point of time but then the stock could be cheap but growth avenues are not very visible it is important to first address those issues and then if you have more surplus cash you could go for a buyback because a buyback is more tax efficient than dividends pay out in any case    yes at this stage i do not think the stock should do anything great if they do a buyback there will be a shortterm spike but then longer term i do not think it is very great for the stock,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-founders-may-be-angling-for-a-buyback-sandip-sabharwal/articleshow/57033986.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:26:27

2017-02-04 15:00:00,indian it firms smart enough to find solution a new normal likely narayana murthy founder infosys,knowing the smartness of the indian software industry i believe it will come out with a solution wherein things will be back to perhaps a new normal,  nasscom and the it ceos who are going to us to talk with the administration should use their influence to prevent the h 1b visa order from going through but in case it does go through let us look at what happens there are several possibilities first of all the profitability of the indian software companies is likely to go down it varies from company to company because the entire industry will be impacted as far as the market capitalisation of these companies are concerned it should not make too much of a difference because everybody is sailing in the same sea  there is a second possibility and that is because the indian software industry is playing such a prominent role in this information infrastructure of us corporations they will be in a position to sit down with their customers in the us and renegotiate the prices thereby their profitability will not be impacted as much as we think it would obviously they will have to leave some money on the table for the customer and at the same time they have to lose some profitability  there is a third possibility and that is the indian software industry the indian software companies would do well to innovate further like we did at infosys in 2013 and we came out with what is called visa independent global delivery model wherein we reduced the total effort onsite in a project from about 30 on an average to just 10 we said this 10 will be delivered by local hires we conducted several pilots and almost all the pilots were pretty successful therefore the entire industry may move towards visa independent global delivery model just as in the 90s infosys moved to the global delivery model the entire industry followed it  therefore i personally feel that there is no need for us to be unduly concerned about it there is no need for us to go into a panic mode knowing the smartness of the indian software industry i believe it will come out with a solution wherein things will be back to perhaps a new normal   even if the us congress were to decide and the senate were to bless it or if the president were to issue an executive order it is very likely that this order will be over the new h1b visas that will be issued it may not be on a retrospective basis number two just now i spoke about the visa independent global delivery model where we can reduce the total effort by as much as 200 in other words from 30 of the total effort to 10 which means using the same talent we should be able to do three times the total revenue for these companies and third i think the local hiring will obviously have to be stepped up because at the end of the day the local talent will be much better in selling our services in the market to their corporations  the local will be able to interact with our customers much better because they speak english as mother tongue they understand the lingo their local jargons etc overall we will convert what appears to be a huge problem at this point of time to a great opportunity for the indian software industry to grow   the reality is that politicians in any country have the responsibility to ensure that the unemployment levels in their country is as low as possible therefore we cannot blame them let us remember what itself did a few years ago when upa government was in power at that time when chinese companies were charged with building power plants in india and they wanted to bring chinese labour because there are very stiff completion targets the government of india said that you must give a minimum wage of 25000 a year for construction workers for power plant builders that was probably six or seven times the salary that we would pay such a person in india  so it is nothing new to us alone we have done it ourselves and we all realised that it was done for a good reason by our politicians we cannot blame them therefore i would not go into a tizzy on this issue i would accept it as reality and it is our responsibility to come out with a mechanism whereby we reduce our dependence on visas    i do not know whether i would like to use the word negotiation the right phrase would be our competence our good work ethic our desire to put customer first  these are the hallmarks of the indian software professional therefore what nasscom will do and the ceos will do is to enlighten the members of the congress and the senators and others that are in power about the extraordinary advantages of working with indian companies they will also enlighten those people on how the indian companies have added tremendous value to making the american companies much more competitive and perhaps they will also talk about the taxes that the indian companies have paid and the that the indian companies have created not just in the it sector alone but in secondary sectors also that is what i would say   no it is not the question of doing better value addition that has always been the focus of indian software companies the issue is simply this  no management and no board of a company should depend so much on the policies of any government that is the fundamental principle of identification and risk because this a huge risk you have no control over governments  let me give you a very simple example in the early eighties the government of india made it so difficult for us to import computers there were no telephone lines there were no communication lines what did we do at that time because the us government was so friendly we did the entire project onsite in fact all my colleagues nandan chris shibu raghavan everybody was in the us i was the only person in india  therefore we cannot fight any government let us remember whether it is us government uk government indian government etc no business can fight any government we will have to work within the constraints of the government and there is a lot of innovation that we can bring to the table whereby our companies are safe our companies can grow well again grow profitably and we can make the customers winners so that is what we should be doing   no we were doing it definitely we were doing it but these go to the backburners if it is not a burning issue therefore we will have to bring it back to the frontburner we will have to refresh their memories and we will have to ensure that they remember the extraordinary contribution of the industry when they are discussing those decisions   well i started this in 2013 the visa independent global delivery model you will have to ask the infosys board similarly you will have to ask other boards where these initiatives are because we completed about seven or eight pilots before i left the company and i am sure they would have taken it forward and you can ask the senior management of infosys as well board of infosys how those initiatives are going i am not in a position to answer that,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/indian-it-firms-smart-enough-to-find-solution-a-new-normal-likely-narayana-murthy-founder-infosys/articleshow/56969420.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08

come out with a solution wherein things will be back to perhaps a new normal   even if the us congress were to decide and the senate were to bless it or if the president were to issue an executive order it is very likely that this order will be over the new h1b visas that will be issued it may not be on a retrospective basis number two just now i spoke about the visa independent global delivery model where we can reduce the total effort by as much as 200 in other words from 30 of the total effort to 10 which means using the same talent we should be able to do three times the total revenue for these companies and third i think the local hiring will obviously have to be stepped up because at the end of the day the local talent will be much better in selling our services in the market to their corporations  the local will be able to interact with our customers much better because they speak english as mother tongue they understand the lingo their local jargons etc overall we will convert what appears to be a huge problem at this point of time to a great opportunity for the indian software industry to grow   the reality is that politicians in any country have the responsibility to ensure that the unemployment levels in their country is as low as possible therefore we cannot blame them let us remember what itself did a few years ago when upa government was in power at that time when chinese companies were charged with building power plants in india and they wanted to bring chinese labour because there are very stiff completion targets the government of india said that you must give a minimum wage of 25000 a year for construction workers for power plant builders that was probably six or seven times the salary that we would pay such a person in india  so it is nothing new to us alone we have done it ourselves and we all realised that it was done for a good reason by our politicians we cannot blame them therefore i would not go into a tizzy on this issue i would accept it as reality and it is our responsibility to come out with a mechanism whereby we reduce our dependence on visas    i do not know whether i would like to use the word negotiation the right phrase would be our competence our good work ethic our desire to put customer first  these are the hallmarks of the indian software professional therefore what nasscom will do and the ceos will do is to enlighten the members of the congress and the senators and others that are in power about the extraordinary advantages of working with indian companies they will also enlighten those people on how the indian companies have added tremendous value to making the american companies much more competitive and perhaps they will also talk about the taxes that the indian companies have paid and the that the indian companies have created not just in the it sector alone but in secondary sectors also that is what i would say   no it is not the question of doing better value addition that has always been the focus of indian software companies the issue is simply this  no management and no board of a company should depend so much on the policies of any government that is the fundamental principle of identification and risk because this a huge risk you have no control over governments  let me give you a very simple example in the early eighties the government of india made it so difficult for us to import computers there were no telephone lines there were no communication lines what did we do at that time because the us government was so friendly we did the entire project onsite in fact all my colleagues nandan chris shibu raghavan everybody was in the us i was the only person in india  therefore we cannot fight any government let us remember whether it is us government uk government indian government etc no business can fight any government we will have to work within the constraints of the government and there is a lot of innovation that we can bring to the table whereby our companies are safe our companies can grow well again grow profitably and we can make the customers winners so that is what we should be doing   no we were doing it definitely we were doing it but these go to the backburners if it is not a burning issue therefore we will have to bring it back to the frontburner we will have to refresh their memories and we will have to ensure that they remember the extraordinary contribution of the industry when they are discussing those decisions   well i started this in 2013 the visa independent global delivery model you will have to ask the infosys board similarly you will have to ask other boards where these initiatives are because we completed about seven or eight pilots before i left the company and i am sure they would have taken it forward and you can ask the senior management of infosys as well board of infosys how those initiatives are going i am not in a position to answer that,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/indian-it-firms-smart-enough-to-find-solution-a-new-normal-likely-narayana-murthy-founder-infosys/articleshow/56969420.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08

2017-01-19 16:00:00,we may be entering a more business friendly innovation friendly regime in us vishal sikka infosys,the last 12 months seem to be more about the people that have been left behind and doing things to be more inclusive to be more empathetic says sikka,     there is a sense of uncertainty there is a sense of not knowing what is going to happen but there is also an emerging sense of optimism and a sense of action of doing something about the issues that we have seen in many ways the world of has been very successful especially in the world of and there is a growing sense of what we are doing to improve things if you look at the events of the last 12 months they seem to be more about the people that have been left behind in the wake of all this success so doing some tangible things to be more inclusive to be more empathetic is something that is coming out of the discussions here    the general sense is that we are going to enter into a more business friendly more innovation friendly kind of regime and therefore many industries will benefit from that for example banking bfsi pharmaceuticals many parts of manufacturing  manufacturing will take on increased importance both local as well as technologically amplified manufacturing like the example that you see that we have put together here so there are some of those industries that will benefit more clearly more obviously than others generally everybody has to reshape their strategies and in light of the policy changes that will go into effect but we have to keep in mind that all the policy changes that people expect and so forth will happen under the broader context of this technological change  so the technological change the technological disruption is not going anywhere and that ai i there is tremendous amount of interest in ai everybody wants to know about it we have done probably we have met about more than 200 clients already everyone has ai on their minds    we do not know that yet we do not know what the policy changes will be that will go into effect depending on the nature of the policies obviously there may or may not be impact but what is generally true is that the administration is going to be a probusiness proinnovation proentrepreneurship administration and therefore if we are able to accelerate our transformation if we are able to become much more relevant to our customers on these strategic innovation oriented areas then we will be fine    yes it is there is a skill shortage in the new areas but there is these numbers are still small enough that these things can be overcome but clearly the right solution for our customers is more local hiring more local context and then that local hiring amplified by the best of what the world can offer the more global best practices and best talent so i think a combination will be the right answer but i have ever since i started here in the last two and a half years i have strongly advocated local hiring less dependence on visas more dependence on technology to bring us closer together all of those things will have to be done    no no as much as possible local hiring we are very committed to in the us i myself am a senior local hire of infosys but of course not only in us also in other countries singapore has gone to 5050 rule and we have been complying to in australia everywhere that we do business we have to do more local hiring and it is i think it is not correct to assume that local hiring means that change in margin profile because it is possible that people that you bring from elsewhere on visas are actually more expensive than local talent that may be available so all of these things have to be reexamined in more detail as the policies become clearer    i do not think so i am an optimist so we have to separate the near term things like the policy changes and so forth from the broader changes that are afoot in society on the job skills point for example one of the things that we are very deeply committed to is education  in india obviously we get kids out of colleges by the tens or thousands but we also train them significantly in our mysore campus our training programme is 2425 weeks long so that makes them more ready for participation in the world of work  in the us our foundation has a lot of work in skilling students and also now in skilling adults and skilling teachers in bringing computer science education longer term my deeply held sense is that we are entering into the times of ai  over the last 12 months many ai applications have become quite successful but they are still very narrow applications compared to the time when i studied it i look at this with the sense of both opportunity and bemusement about all the interest in ai,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/we-may-be-entering-a-more-business-friendly-innovation-friendly-regime-in-us-vishal-sikka-infosys/articleshow/56666206.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:26:43

2017-01-13 13:00:00,the declines we saw this quarter will reverse themselves infosys management,the cost optimisation that we have undertaken in the company is not in the areas that will hurt growth said ranganath,  overall we are relatively optimistic what we have seen in this quarter is not a secular trend it is more a seasonal weakness   on the back of our pipeline the fact that we dont see any industry specific trend or any cut down in projects etc our clients however continue to be cautious in the sense that they are also trying to white out on how the new us regime will look whether there will be any policies and so on so to that extent some of those cautiousness in terms of taking decisions particularly when it involves large outsourcing projects will probably continue for some time but if we look at our pipeline if we look at some of the other areas we are looking at we dont see any client specific trends of slowdown or anything so that gives us the optimism and confidence that some of the declines we have seen across this board this quarter will probably reverse themselves in the coming quarters   as i said earlier this particular quarter operating margin has expanded it is at 251 net margin have expanded to 215 operating cash is 100 of pat so look at the first nine months of this year because quarter to quarter there are seasonality so look at the first nine months of this year and compare with the last nine months of last year operating margin has been steady at 247 despite the drop in the revenue growth as compared to last year which essentially means that we are able to and there was 17 price decline year on year which essentially means that despite that pricing decline of 17 using these levers we are able to hold the operating margins successfully so far this year now in october we had given the margin band of 24 to 25 for this year we are likely to be at the higher end of that band now coming to the levers as we have been saying for the last couple of quarters there are four levers that we continue to optimise which is the utilisation utilisation as vishal was saying for q3 has been healthy and for the last seven quarters consistently utilisation has been above 80 better talent planning better cycle time management and things like that second is the subcontractor expenses it used to be 63 of revenue same quarter last year and has come down to 56 this particular quarter now at the same time there are other levers like onsite mix mix it is 298 and we were working towards how to gradually address that and bring it down now the cost optimisation that we have undertaken in this company is not in the areas that will hurt growth we do not want to optimise an areas like sales in areas like where you have to invest for future growth,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/the-declines-we-saw-this-quarter-will-reverse-themselves-infosys-management/articleshow/56515295.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:27:39
2017-01-13 16:00:00,we expect president trumps government to be business friendly vishal sikka infosys,we have to focus more on local hiring this is something that i have been working on for the last twoandahalf years said the infosys ceo,    we have more visibility and we are confident about q4 therefore we have raised the bottom end to 84 in q3 we had some seasonal impact because of furloughs we also took the brunt of the rbs impact in q3 and it impacted more than 1 of our revenues globally so those will be now behind us to a large degree and we are confident about q4 and that is the reason for the guidance    my own sense is that if you look at presidentelect donald trumps journey his life he is all about innovation being a businessman and entrepreneur we expect that the government is going to be business friendly and innovation friendly entrepreneurship friendly and in that sense the business atmosphere will be much more open to innovation open to breakthroughs and new ideas as long as we are focussed on that it is going to be fine there will be some changes we have to focus more on local hiring this is something that i have been working on for the last twoandahalf years since i started and i myself am a local hire and it is something that is healthy for delivering innovation anyway you need a combination of strong local talent together with the world class talent from around the globe where we can bring the best of what is possible to our clients so whether it is australia or europe or in singapore for that matter where recently they went to this 5050 policy and we have been complying with that in the long run it is a good thing    i heard that no changes we have a very stable very high performing management team    no no absolutely not our four presidents myself and krish and our team  sanjay navin ritika we have a very strong team deepak is here sangita has just joined us from sudhir just joined us from it is a very strong cohesive management team we work together very well and we always want to look for new talent there are always changes that are possible this is what i was saying but there are no changes that are planned we are going through a very difficult transformation as a company it is not easy for a 10 billion company and 200000 people going through such a fundamental change in this kind of a climate so you need a very tight trusted team and i am very proud of the team that we have pravin and i run this together for the last two and a half years we have run this together  it is difficult for people outside to understand the kind of trust and deeply held relationship that pravin and i have in jointly running this company he is my partner and when ranga took over as cfo he appointed jayesh as his deputy and that model worked very well as we saw our increasing scale and the dramatic transformation that is happening we felt that it would be good for ravi to come back here earlier we used to have lot of management in india and so we felt that it would be great for ravi to be here as pravins deputy and helping out operation and then pravin told me today that do not call me after 10 pm anymore    another 36 years to a 100 billion is what you are thinking that is not bad this is testimony to the founders and the employees who have brought the company to this point and i remember when i started it was just over 8 billion  so we have added close to 2 billion in the last two and a half years the journey ahead is all about innovation all about automation and mastering automation  we are living in a time where ai is becoming extremely prevalent and although we are still in very early stages of ai there is a lot more work that needs to happen it is going to have a significant impact on our industry we should be able to embrace a culture of automation early to free ourselves up to do more and deliver innovation that is what is needed in the times ahead so we want to renew the services that we presently have all the way from our digital bi product engineering and especially application development and maintenance and infrastructure on the basis of this automation and innovation and augment that with new software led services with the mana platform panaya and some of the new services that we have launched like the small and medium size business services  it is a combination of renew and new strategy that will get us to 100 billion in 36 years   demonetisation that you have seen so far as far as the india business is concerned  that it is a huge opportunity for digital i was in mumbai the day before yesterday and there is a lot of excitement around digital payments this is a disruptive event which in the long run could be a hugely positive event it is a very bold move by the prime minister and it is going to lead to a much faster much more accelerated embrace of digital  of course for us that is a good thing because finacle is a huge part of the financial backbone in india and we have been working on gst and we have been working on the department of post becoming banking service providers as india becomes more digital and financial infrastructure becomes more digital this is a very good

2016-10-15 00:00:00,rampdown by a couple of clients affected our results vishal sikka infosys,we will never buy growth we are not interested in that life is too short to do that what good is an aspiration if it is not aspirationalsikka said,   i think that our approach on guidance as i have said before is to make sure that what we see is what we talk about and what we say it as we see it we operate in a very volatile where there are internal factors but external factors and ramp downs that affects clients  affects us we have approximately 1000 clients the number of clients is not that large and the top 250 produce most of the revenues  so anytime there is a rampdown for various reasons even if they have nothing to do with us we get affected by that in the near term and sometimes it is very difficult to foresee that therefore you have to constantly focus whether the underlying fundamentals are moving forward in a good way or not on those fronts we have been making continuously good progress  in terms of the near term guidance we have been affected by a couple of these ramp downs and our peers in the industry have also gone through a similar experience   no it is none of those structural things it is just a couple of clients yes in our case those couple of these clients have been impacted by but i cannot say that brexit is causing us to lower the guidance that would be wrong we tend to overstate the impact of external factors it is largely internal factors that contribute to these things and as i said rampdowns in a few cases can have a significant impact on term revenue this is what we are   we will never buy growth we are not interested in that life is too short to do that what good is an aspiration if it is not aspirational   20 billion by 2020 is an aspiration it is what we have aspired toi such a steep target and that is what makes it exciting to go after however our guidance on our forecast are based on what we see in the near term where we have a better ability to handle  our revenue guidance is on a yearly basis and over the course of a year we revise it best on what we see and that is what we will continue to do but in the meantime we continue to have a great approach and idea is not only that it is an aspiration it is that we want that to be a consequence of the work that we do meaning to develop ourselves into an automation and innovation led company so that the profitability revenue growth and the revenue per employee growth all get us to that point   it is because we are now approaching 10 billion from revenue and trailing four quarters we will cross it this quarter so that means that the three sales presidents are handling more than 3 billion sort of responsibility each in addition they also have serious global responsibilities unique ones mohit for operational sales sandeep in the new services and software and rajesh in consulting and design thinking  therefore it is important to improve their bandwidth and to a large degree we have done that from within but we have also brought in from outside also it is a refocusing and restructuring exercise it is being done mostly to improve the bandwidth of our leadership and increase the agility and flexibility while at the same time making sure that we have a very sharp accountability and focus so those are not just buzz word it is important at a large scale for a company to operate with those principals and that is what we have done      sas obviously is a actually a huge opportunity i do not know why people think that this is somehow a negative force four our industry it is actually an extremely positive force move to the cloud is a huge opportunity from legacy infrastructure we continue to see great growth in that great partnership with amazon and with microsoft as well as other companies like oracle and so forth in terms of the other areas that you have mentioned in there the sort of the declining forces my sense is that if we are able to get next generation digital services new kinds of offerings around innovation i think that there is tremendous amount of value to be delivered in that and that is what my focus is     it is not so much eating into from a market share perspective but it is clearly taking out a lot of the growth because clients have all these options available to them we in fact invested in a small company that helps businesses establish their own captives ansr consulting my sense is that the model that we had read let us say 15 or so years ago or 20 years ago there was an extreme differentiation at that time all you had to say was we were infosys that we have the massive ability to train and teach and we are based in india with the economics of the global delivery model and then you know the cheques were being written money was falling from the skies but this is not the case anymore     i do not think so i mean the large impact on margin comes from pricing from our own delivery of our services utilisation cost of employees and so forth so i do not think that and of course one of the big factors there the big levers that is automation how automation will play in role in improving the productivity of our services and the economics of our services so we tend to overstate the effect of things like brexit and oil prices and so forth and elections and all that but the reality is in our business ramp ups of projects take a while ramp downs have an immediate effect on revenues so they can affect our quarterly result and so every once in a while a brexit like event can impact a client where you happen to have a huge investment and if there is a ramp down then that affects you but to say that brexit is impacting the industry as such is nonsense     if you look at what we call the title holder attrition that is around 4 or 45 that is also something that we are quite happy about in terms of the executives see we are going through a very fundamental transformation a multidimensional transformation on the one hand it is the atmosphere that our client see in the pervasive digitisation and the kind of change that they see the kind of cost that they see and so

check multiples do not look very comfortable but that does not matter   is the only spot of cheer in an otherwise gloomy people are chasing yields and they will keep coming into india but will it persist into q3 and q4 and will things get challenging in terms of implied multiples and actual growth that is being spewed out is a question which will come in a while i do not think this quarter itself is going to give us a turning point    i agree with you it in a global sense is driving into uncharted territory they are a very capable set of people and they represent some of the finest brains this country has to offer no doubt about that but there is a transformation happening and some of them might be caught napping despite the brave noises that they keep making from time to time personally i do not think they are going to fall off a cliff  we have gone through these challenges when y2k happened and when even 2008 happened and a lot of these it blocks have actually come back they seem to have deep pools of talent hidden away and when there is a fire in the house they are able to put out these fires  however what is happening this time is that it is doing to itself what it has done to other industries so the digital transformation the movement towards products and platforms the requirement for custom software being shipped overseas and off shore and then being delivered the entire game looks a little challenged not from a six month or a two years or one year perspective but may be from a five year perspective there might be some kind of disruption which is just beginning to show up right now in the form of lower quarter on quarter growth rates   the rbs contract has fallen off there are worries the pound has cracked and mr sikka is doing all he can a magnificent and multipronged transformation is playing out at infosys and it is coming not a minute too soon  our bet is that sikka is going to make it and infosys is going to return to glory 1213x headline multiples can probably go to 14x if future guidance changes a bit i do not think 1314x is an issue for a company that is sitting on piles of cash where corporate governance is not an issue and which can beat half the world hands down when it comes to being competitive i do not think infosys is going to get written off in a hurry not with sikka at the helm     there is going to be a cushion of falling interest rates and treasury gains but it is not quite an achievement of the psu banks it is just a good thing that is going to happen to them over this quarter and may be for some more quarters to come but many of them are capital challenged right now many of them have got headline asset quality numbers anywhere between 6 and 10 stressed numbers there is so little in the macros or in the policy framework that tells me that a massive cleanup of asset quality is going to happen across the board and that is what these psu banks actually need   this quarter if you get a trading opportunity and you can sell off some of the smaller psu banks just because they are reporting treasury gains i think you should seriously consider that there might be a couple of very interesting things happening at the lower end of the psu pack also with idbi set for a complete transformation we do not have them under coverage we have tried to take a deep look once in a while and we have got i must confess we have got a little put off in the past however a very large and signalling kind of corporate action there from the government in terms of divestment might completely change the trajectory for idbi we do not have them under coverage we do not have an official recommendations but yes i would love to do a deep dive sometime   each one of these guys has got multiple slices and which is why you feel that you are in a slippery bit of zone right now so mahindra has got twothree different slices on their business in fact they are losing big time money on their two wheeler business something that has gone under the radar for a lot of investors but that is a different story for a different day  hero offers the opportunity to have a pure play you have a good monsoon two wheelers look good their numbers have been coming out very decent their product line up their product pipe looks very interesting and their launches are now spread across not just the commuter space and they are poise to regain market share in scooters very good from a longterm perspective valuations are still affordable versus maruti or someone else  on tata motors global sluggishness does not seem to matter at all the local cv cycle does not seem to matter when it goes up or down the part that really moves for tata motors is jlr which is like 85 of consolidated valuations at this stage even as we speak despite global macro sluggishness the rich are not getting any poorer so with a successful product launch pipe jlr looks good for the next two or three years so good that we have almost like a permanent buy on tata motors  we have owned it since when it was priced 3040 lower i do not see that changing in a hurry interestingly the reason why we loved maruti for a while now and we continue to love it is the big surge in discretionary consumption that is playing out in this country whether it is driven by bad monsoons or good monsoons this time onethird or more of the sales happens in rural india or whether it is because of the seventh pay commission and increasing urbanisation and the aspirational value of vehicle ownership along with fuel prices remaining within control  all that is feeding into maruti but for a company like force motors half of its revenues is in profits coming from assembling engines gear boxes and so on for mercedes which has been the big surprise among luxury car brands in india this company is planning to spend something like rs 1200 crore over the next four or five years in terms of expanding their operations whether it is on their travellers and the van business the small passenger van or mini bus business and whether it is or the work that they do for bmw and mercedes  there are derive demand stories there are direct demand stories discretionary consumption also feeds into the business of vguard you may see appliances scaling out in rural india in the next few years the way they scaled out in urban india so here is a great opportunity for that big laggard in this space  bajaj electricals  to do a catch up i would be very closely watching out for their successes or failures as they play out  cromptons consumer business is now sliced out into an appliances business which has got very high return ratios and extremely high capital efficiency vguard like i said is expanding its tentacles into the north india market so these are all very exciting spaces  discretionary consumption for me is a theme which is likely to play out over the next four or five years in this country and you might see some stupid multiples play out eicher you are already seeing it right and i still do not think eicher is too costly by any stretch of imagination  remember the first time we excited about eicher about five or six years ago was because they had a very good and hardworking cv business and lot of people accidentally bought it for that   for quite a few of them while it would not be a make or break quarter we will definitely be watching them very closely a lot of serious money has been made in the specialty chemicals space we have been amongst the people who have been thumping the table on stocks like navin fluorine or a dhanuka or a pi industries and so on  some of them feed into agri demand some of them have got stock specific stories like custom synthesis in the case of pi dhanuka or an insecticides india would feed into monsoon related agri demand surging after two bad monsoons  guys like vinati for example have got very stock specific stories on how their business is expanding or the fluorochemical space but a lot of these guys are now in a territory where valuations are demanding and remember these are not front line companies so that you can keep on holding onto them or that investors are going to keep holding on to them just because there is a macro theme which is playing out in their favour  we will watch these companies very very closely orient has recently acquired the jaiprakash assets where they have added 4 million tonnes of grinding capacity and one more million tonne of clinker to feed into that of they will probably need another million tonnes on clinker pretty soon their leverage is going to change the price of acquisition does not seem to be unaffordable but all these guys are now going to come back into the radar and we are going to ask them some tough questions if they perform this quarter it is fine if they do not they can give us good reasons and they can point to a future which make sense from a valuation perspective and from a story perspective lots of these guys have got twothree years stories built into them and that is fine as otherwise some of them might get punished,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/sikka-is-going-to-make-it-and-infosys-is-going-to-return-to-glory-dipen-seth/articleshow/54807000.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08

2016-09-09 11:00:00,we prefer infosys over tcs shashi bhusan idfc securities,if you look at any global 2000 company or fortune 500 company it is not that they are completely discarding their legacy system it is just that they want to spend more on newer technologies,   you need to understand the we are in right now global growth is not accelerating right now and then there is disruption because of technologies it is not only that indian it companies are getting disrupted because of the newer but their clients are also getting disrupted because of this new technology innovation  in such an environment there will be uncertainties around the demand environment and to add to that there are some politics whether it is us election protectionism which will all add to the uncertainty in the overall environment for the indian it  q1 and q2 both events run up to the and post brexit there have been a little bit hesitation in terms of a spending on it by some of the clients and there are client specific issues for some of the companies if you have seen a commentary they have talked about specific discretionary spend from bfsi in the us that have been impacted of late and that is what resulted in their profit warning in case of also there were a few clients that have actually gone through a rough phase and that is going to result in softer q2 yes there are uncertainties and since q1 and q2 happen to be seasonally strong quarters the revenue trajectory for indian it has actually been reset at lower than expected momentum and that would definitely lead to lower revenue growth and lower target price for most of the companies   in 19992000 we were not incumbents and at that time we kept on gaining because started offshoring and offshoring was the trend that captured the imagination of especially us and clients and that resulted in strong growth for indian it  right now is fairly big and around 100 plus billion revenue comes from these and big component of that is legacy which is getting disrupted because of the newer technologies either cloud or digital smac but if you look at the overall revenue contribution from this newer technology it is in low to mid teens for some companies it is slightly higher but other than that i see most of the companies are still under mid teens  we think that once clients are clear about how much and what they want to spend clarity will emerge and the revenue growth will pick up if you look at any global 2000 company or fortune 500 company it is not that they are completely discarding their legacy system and spending all out in the newer technologies it is just that they want to spend more on newer technologies  they are doing some saving from the legacy by cutting down on prices doing some automation over there and then reinvesting those and topping it up and investing it in digital now how much share of that indian it will get and continue getting over the next one or two years will drive the course of revenue growth for indian it and that is where we need to see we are at an inflection point and there will be some winners some loser there will be some casualties definitely a few companies are working with the right strategy i think those companies will be eventual winner in this newer technology wave   infy and tcs both are great businesses with incredible credibility of their managements tcs has shown their execution capability over the last seveneight years it is just that sometimes valuation gaps inch up and then we start recommending one stock over another but it is not that tcs is going to lose out in this race and infy is going to surge ahead some of the infy strategies make it look like clients are appreciating their design thinking training their employees on design thinking training some of their clients on design thinking making the microsegment of 700 odd million dividing the business into units which tcs has already done i think those strategies will play out in favour of infy and the valuation gap was huge that is why we are preferring over tcs  som 10 years from now both these companies are going to be there and growing and surviving and thriving right now there is uncertainty and that will stay for some more time we have seen in the past some political uncertainty during election years and people keep raising question about the structural sustainability of their business model but i think those things are slightly stretched many of these good companies will survive and thrive in their next technology wave as well but yes there will be some companies who will lose out on this technology disruption which we are seeing right now   so we continue to prefer mindtree and persistent in the midcap right now and we feel that both these companies have got great management great team mindtree has already shown that their digital revenue contribution has been growing ahead of industry right now around 40 of their revenue comes from the digital and i think in case of persistent we need to watch out that how exactly their watson iot deal plays out if it plays out well that will be a game changer for persistent so these two are our preferred picks along with that there are two value picks and kpit technologies,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/we-prefer-infosys-over-tcs-shashi-bhusan-idfc-securities/articleshow/54222711.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:35:59

2016-07-19 17:00:00,grab infosys now that it is so reasonably priced parag thakkar hdfc securities,in a range between rs 1020 and rs 1080 infosys is a stock that longterm investors should accumulate,  sure so i continue with my thesis that good companies you get at a reasonable valuation only when there is some shortterm problem on a couple of occasions we have discussed pharma same way lupin when it was at around rs 1450 same way i would say that infosys is in the range between rs 1020 and rs 1080 it is a good range for longterm investors to accumulate you cannot expect huge returns from infosys because the industry is getting matured   this has been the trend in the market that everything where there is a clear revenue clear earning visibility and growth of about 2025 per cent cagr and no management concerns continues to get very huge premium but i will be slightly cautious in some of these stocks not because they are bad but because they run very well they are doing very well but in my view the valuations just do not compel you to buy that is the problem with these stocks   generally in the nbfc space i would like to stick to older names like sundaram finance my view of market is that it is getting overvalued not from a shortterm perspective at least considering that whatever the global situation is i would like to stay with managements where i am absolutely comfortable and valuations which i find reasonable so in midcaps i would like to be in murugappa group names or sundaram group names these are two managements where i am having absolute comfort so basically in murugappa group i was very bullish on chola sundaram finance and sundaram fasteners in murugappa group now carborundum universal is looking very good so i would like to stick to those kind of names in midcap space   it can give you 20 per cent cagr easily from here because   yes the murugappa group as we all know is a rs 22000 crore group they grow with least dilution with least possible debt in carborundum there is a clean cash flow last year carborundum generated rs 225 crore operating cash flow and some of their segments are very sensitive to gdp average generally in the long term they grow at 15 x gdp they have an industrial ceramic division which caters to coal washeries as we all know power minister piyush goyal has said that he wants to increase his washed from 90 million tonnes to 250 million tonnes in five years so that is a great opportunity for carborundum on one hand they cater to all auto and auto components which is a great theme because of monsoon gst the seventh pay commission and if the scrappage policy is also passed it will add fuel to the fire   i completely agree with that and that is what i meant that in it companies you cannot expect significant returns from here the industry is getting mature it spending is now gradually moving towards digital and in this transition the size of the deals are getting smaller so the revenue visibility or predictability which it companies had like utility companies are now coming in for a little bit of a risk so that kind of earning multiple downgrades have to happen and partially it is happening with this quarters numbers so as we move towards completion of this quarters numbers somewhere there will be a bottom formation for it companies   when you buy during this kind of bottoms you are not absolutely certain that you are entering at a right point only but you have to keep faith that good companies find their way out that is what happened with lupin so many facilities got approved and suddenly you are seeing a 15 per cent jump in the price so who knows next quarter infosys might outperform and then you will get it for rs 12001225 so you have to buy during problems,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/grab-infosys-now-that-it-is-so-reasonably-priced-parag-thakkar-hdfc-securities/articleshow/53284755.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:39:13

2016-07-15 18:00:00,in the medium term we have always been comfortable with 2426 margin guidance md ranganath infosys,we had a 45 per cent improvement in the deal wins last year and even in this quarter the deal wins momentum is same,    we have reiterated our margin guidance for 2426 per cent this year and we have always said that in the medium term that is the range that we are comfortable with last year we ended at exactly midpoint 25 per cent there are sets of parameters which impact the margins one is of course as you said the revenue trajectory apart from that there are two other pieces one is the cost optimisation levers and the second one is the automation one in the short term however we do believe that the cost optimisation levers that we have been using that is utilisation or expense for example subcon expense was 63 per cent of revenues three quarters ago in q3 now it is 54 per cent it come down to 56 per cent last quarter it again came down to 54 per cent this quarter the trajectory is in the right direction likewise utilisation which is consistently above 80 per cent for the last five quarters increased further to 805 per cent and we do believe that there is scope we have done in the past 8283 per cent and we have confidence that we can do that again and we are focussing on utilisation as well    energy is something we anticipate rest of the year will be safe that is something we have always said and we do not see that changing in the rest of the year life sciences to some extent was a bit of a surprise we had not anticipated it at the beginning of the quarter and when you look at discretionary impact through erp and consulting most of the impact happened by coincidence in the life sciences vertical and so they got impacted hopefully over a period of time it should pick up so unlike energy we are more optimistic about life sciences it should pick up and from a geography perspective again the impact by coincidence again most of the negative growth in life sciences has happened in europe that is why europe has come down but in future i think depending on how brexit and the uncertainty and other things europe could potentially be softer but right now we have not seen any visible signs on the plan we have to wait and watch    as i was explaining earlier we had a 45 per cent improvement in the deal wins last year and even in this quarter the deal wins momentum is same if you look at the deals the deal ramp up is a factor of the kind of service line that we deal in for example in infrastructure management we have transition then the shadow support and then the steady state the deal has a trajectory so the revenue kind of mimics the trajectory typically in infrastructure deal it is lower whereas if you look at application development deals or maintenance deals it is more uniform and quick rampups so it is a combination of the kind of the service that we have in the deal if you look at our current service mix roughly for every 100 million tcv wins about 710 per cent of the revenue accrues in the first year so you have not seen significant change in that year because these deals are typically multiyear and we have not seen any significant change in this pattern  and to some extent the growth we saw last year part of it you have to attribute to the large deal wins whereas in the past if you look at few years back we really struggled for growth because we were not very successful in the large deal ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/in-the-medium-term-we-have-always-been-comfortable-with-24-26-margin-guidance-md-ranganath-infosys/articleshow/53227989.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:40:34
2016-07-16 17:00:00,one quarter result does not impact our longterm ambitions vishal sikka infosys,the nature of our business is such that the impact on the first quarter gets reflected in the subsequent quarters more prominently,     the revenue performance in the quarter was below what we expected and also below what the street expected this being the first quarter when your projects are out the impact of that is more and the less than expected revenue growth gets reflected in the subsequent quarters in a year as a result we have brought the guidance down i am not particularly worried about it these are areas that we are focusing on but the nature of our business is such that the impact on the first quarter gets reflected in the subsequent quarters more prominently   i do not see any impact on longterm aspirations results of one quarter do not impact that our march towards the transformation of our company into a company where everybody works out of a philosophy of innovation and value creation continues it is a fact that it has been going quite well and i am very encouraged by the progress that we have made so the longer term ambition of the work that we are doing is not impacted and there is no slowdown in that front  the core business renewal of our core delivery services on the basis of automation and innovation that has been happening in delivery actually grew by 34 per cent in the course of this quarter and the new business has been going extremely well and the cutting edge and the design thinking and so forth as well as the large deal wins so the parts that did not work well are some of the pockets of our businesses that are outside of these two and those we will address as we go forward   no no i mean we do not know the impact of brexit yet we are yet to find out if there is any longer term impact once it is clear how things will settle down and if indeed these systems become isolated then that will create some more opportunity for us but in the near term this is too early to tell customers do not even know yet they were also surprised by this as much as anybody else and so they do not know the impact of these things in the near term yet   we are quite excited about that we have been growing on that we did 700 plus in the previous quarter 800 plus this quarter so we are getting close to it   there is always rhetoric in the election times but i do not expect any massive change to any of these visa policies and so forth and in any case if you look at our execution i am a us citizen and we have been hiring more and more citizens and permanent residents whether it is in the us or in or in australia or other geographies our goal is to hire local talent and augment that with which is in and off shore    absolutely it has been exciting    ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/one-quarter-result-does-not-impact-our-long-term-ambitions-vishal-sikka-infosys/articleshow/53227636.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:40:38
2016-07-15 16:00:00,we are maintaining a rs 13001350 target on infosys gaurang shah geojit bnp paribas,we are maintaining a positive stance as of now and we hope and believe that the strategies and the team which is in place at the helm at infosys is definitely capable of navigating the company through this trouble quarter,     i have been already in the band for a long time and right from the levels of 260 we have been having a positive coverage on lic and time and again post the numbers quarter on quarter that the company has delivered we have upgraded our target and the latest target was somewhere close to about rs 510520 which more or less the stock has achieved as we speak the numbers are just flashing around and on the basis of these numbers upgrade if any would definitely take at least some time later in the evening to come out with at my end but yes given the outlook on the entire hfc segment we are quite upbeat that definitely and not to forget delivered numbers this morning just a while back and those numbers were also much in line or better than what the street estimates were  we think names like lic housing finance hdfc limited can fin homes will definitely do well as we go forward along with dhfl lower interest rates and more affordability is coming through and that is where i think there is going to be a big trigger and with the seventh pay commission some of the tier i tier ii might also see traction in terms of demand and there is also a case of loan book growing on fallback of all these positives    i will keep my fingers crossed for the gst to go through it is more than a decade that we have been hearing the commentary on gst and i only hope and pray that this particular bill sees the light of the day next week when we get back to trade on monday morning on 18th july the parliament session kicks off and according to what the finance minister says if there is consensus and if the bill goes through then it will not only send the right signal to all of us but also to all the big time investors overseas and post independence i think this will be one of the biggest reform bills that will come through and not to forget once it is cleared by the rajya sabha with the support of the opposition party especially congress it will take at least another year yearandahalf for the implementation process to go through of course it will take a while for the positives from gst to translate into gdp growth rate in terms of collection by the government in terms of tax collection etc hope by next week we will have some good    so you get some good you get some bad and yes the commentary was absolutely disturbing to me especially because post numbers late last evening i had my hopes pinned on infosys numbers but there has been a miss and that miss has come through in a matter of three months just one quarter i was also listening into the commentary of the management especially mr vishal sikka you cannot write this particular stock off yes there are uncertainties in terms of what is the roadmap for britain post exit they are yet to talk with the members of the euro zone council for smooth exit rather than have any hard landing it would be prudent to see who becomes the president of the that might also have its impact on the entire it pack if it has to go and swing the other way we are maintaining a positive stance as of now and we hope and believe that the strategies and the team which is in place at the helm at infosys is definitely capable of navigating the company through this trouble quarter so we have not revised our target downward we are maintaining a rs 13001350 target on infosys    half dollar to a dollar is what the miss could be last time it was 108109 correct me if i am wrong this time around i think it is going to be sub10 dollars but i do not think that is going to be a great negativity i think it definitely will still be a smoother as far as the refining margins are concerned we are more optimistic on the petchem which has shown a tremendous sign in terms of growth and outlook going forward from here on it is more prudent to listen to the commentary as far as the long awaited reliance commercial launch is concerned not to forget that they have invested huge in this particular telecom service provider panindia 4g platform which is one of the niche technologies and what is the commentary in terms of when does this new telecom reliance jio business once rolled out would start contributing to the companys overall balance sheet again speaking of reliance it would be prudent on my part to give a disclosure that we have a positive view on reliance industries as well ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/we-are-maintaining-a-rs-1300-1350-target-on-infosys-gaurang-shah-geojit-bnp-paribas/articleshow/53227184.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:40:43

2016-07-15 12:00:00,next quarter is also not going to be good for infosys because of brexit deepak shenoy capital mind,infy does not hold the leadership position anymore it probably goes to tcs,      i think we have seen a 11 per cent constant currency by my calculations roughly they have got 16 per cent revenue growth the dollar has appreciated 54 per cent against the rupee considering averages for the two quarters i believe that at about 11 per cent revenue their profit growth is poorer so i believe from an growth perspective they will probably do in rupee terms about 13 per cent of what they have done in this quarter and i see some negative surprises honestly speaking i am looking at the revenues right now almost everywhere the revenues are doing reasonably well their profits are lower than what we expected so while the revenues have kept pace the profits have disappointed in this quarter     i agree and a lot of things have changed the results are out were supposed to be out at 915 am they are now routinely late by 3045 minutes and we have seen changes in assessment of how their guidance should be looked at typically they would beat guidance this is not really the case so they have had some unprecedented issues  of course with things in the quarter like turning out pretty bad towards the end but i believe you are right the communication needs to be streamlined a little more i was not very positive on it companies but among them infy was looking to be the brightest that has changed i am very positive about it going forward but infy does not hold that leadership position at this point anymore it probably goes to which came out with results yesterday       i was looking at some of those things if you look at what is happening with brexit you know a significant chunk of income for infosys comes from banking and financial services and one of the biggest hubs here is london so a lot of financial services firms are going slow and not progressing their discretionary spends that is obvious because with brexit things will change a lot they will have to cut capex they will have to move things out they will have to do some things it may result in some incremental revenue but some of the discretionary spends will definitely come down  so i believe that revenue is definitely under threat that is more than 20 per cent of their total revenue and so we will have to see how they get compensated for that i believe the next quarter is not going to be good just because of brexit itself it will depend on how they change their revenue mix in the later part of the year and that will probably make a difference this is going to be across the it sector but infosys definitely has some rework to do     actually the problem really is about what you do if you are a financial institution that has a significant base in london and you are subcontracting out to infy you are now starting to worry about how brexit will affect you in the future so you are going to start to diversify you are going to set up offices in berlin or in belgium where european visas are not that easy to get for a company like infy compared to the uk so there is going to be a little bit of consternation over there about how the mix is going to change there is going to be a drop in discretionary spend precisely because they do not how much they are going to have to spend on relocation on changing stuff on what happens really until brexit actually happens and they have a clear path ahead    i do not know if i have visibility into anything that infosys can do by 2020 so i will reserve comment on that but i believe some of the things that they said in the press conference seem to say that some of these items are temporary because some of the rampups of their earlier deals happened late in the quarter so they expect this revenue to flow through in subsequent quarters however i believe they are also a little unaware of the brexit impact  the slowdown actually did not happen in financials it happened in healthcare and a couple of other verticals so i believe the slowdown in finance will happen in this quarter that is the july to september quarter so i do not think we should expect rosy september quarter either i know that they are confident but i think i would underweight that confidence based on market issues right now i think it is a little premature to say that they will be able to maintain their revenue going forward right now without knowing what is going to happen with brexit     okay so two things have happened in this quarter that are quite interesting they have increased utilisation substantially their utilisation including trainees is at the highest levels that i have seen since i have been recording this data at 765 per cent yet their profit per employee has come down to a little bit lower 173 lakh  so while they are able to get more work out of their people they are not able to generate the same kind of profits yet from the people that they have also the revenue per employee has kind of come down a little bit from the last quarter so they are trying for efficiencies in terms of utilisation but they are not able to generate those efficiency and turn them into profits right now so i will have to see how this pans out in terms of profit per employee rs 174 lakh per employee is the lowest we have seen in a while

2016-07-15 12:00:00,q1 numbers are bad infosys failed to fulfill its promise pankaj sharma equirus securities,the topline numbers are very disappointing and that looks very bad versus what the company was guiding for,in a chat with  executive director equirus securities says that the stock could take a further beating before the time ends      see it could be a little more disappointing by the time market ends the topline numbers are very disappointing and that looks very bad versus what the company was guiding for so there were expectations that this is a company that would deliver better than industry growth rates and even better than performance which cognizant would show the latest numbers on top line and sales growth would really not look good and there is a possibility that the stock could be down even more before the time market ends     i completely agree because i think that is a much larger question because whatever has happened in the last four to six quarters an expectation was building that infosys is finally back on track and after a long spell of consistent underperformance it would come back to at least an industry leading or at least a bellwether kind of a status in the industry with revenue growth  this result would make a lot of more circumspect and cautious including us that whether it is really possible and whether it would really happen so i think that is a much larger question and very correctly pointed out by you that the entire assumption of four to six quarters that industry average growth rate would be delivered by infosys in under a question mark and unless there is a credible explanation by the management for this kind of number and this kind of performance i do not think investors are going to like it very much     i think there are two very large issues apart from the numbers one is that how can the management be so inconsistent in last 612 months like there are times when they have given an outlook which is very good and in between they come and say that things are not great so i think it has to be a consistent commentary the second point is that in the first quarter you are revising your guidance by 150 bps and if it happens in third quarter it happens in second quarter it is still okay but in the first quarter if you do that it looks very bad so on a comparable basis we were of the view that infosys is better than tcs but now i think we have to reassess the situation i would not really think that we should take a chance at this point we need to first understand what the management tells us about what went wrong and if we find that consistency in message in other results and what it companies in general would report so it is possible that it industry is struggling and tcs was a bit like an exception where they reported okay kind of numbers everybody else is going to report bad numbers and then infosys might not look that bad so i would probably wait for first look at what management says and then corroborate that with what everybody else comes out with and if that is consistent it is okay but not at this point at all    i would probably expect management to be a bit cautious in the commentary because the damage has been done not by absolute numbers but by absolute numbers versus what the market was expecting if the management understands that this is something which is very damaging to the stock and if they correct that and if they come with explanation which is reasonable and also sets the tone for the rest of the year that we will have pressure we will have issues and we will try to of course mitigate that risk but if they remain bullish i think that would be a worrying sign rather if they say that okay fine we are facing challenges we have problems but we will try to sort them out and we were expecting better things that might work so that is an approach i would probably expect management to take that things are really not great and there is a reason why this has happened but if they remain bullish and if they take a very aggressive stance on this i think it could be more damaging for the stock and that is something i would be worried about the most    yes i think that depends because when you say that it is a problem which is a very quarter specific problem and then you say that okay i expect the same kind of good things and same outlook which is very rosy for rest of the year that is a very different thing compared to what you say that okay this quarter definitely had more issues than what we are expecting but this also reflects that the same things could happen the rest of the year as well so these are very different things altogether they said this quarter had some of the unexpected issues and this might actually get reflected in rest of the year also and the 150 bps cut could actually get worse because 12 per cent growth is still very good if they reach that number i think market would be happy but i really think that after what has happened in the first quarter if they continue to remain very aggressive about that estimate people would not like it very much    so if you see that purely on the basis of first quarter result i think the stock has already factored that in so if i expect that even you have an expectation which is 810 per cent less and lower in what they would deliver in fy17 i think that part is already factored in so i would not really mind buying infosys at this price but again as i said it is dependent on what happens on the guidance and what happens on the commentary for rest of the year but purely from first quarter results perspective and the numbers which have come in i think stock has already factored that in and it is a decent price nothing to get worried about

2016-07-14 12:00:00,it is company specific infosys and tcs should do well sandeep muthangi iifl institutional equities,brexit happened at the fagend of the quarter and this quarter per se should not see much of an impact but would be felt more in the next couple of years going forward,    brexit is one of the issues but i guess there are more issues in the quarter both positive and negative to start off this will be a decent quarter for it at least and should have a good quarter from a revenue growth perspective i do not see any slowdown in comparison with what they delivered last year last year first quarter was a decent quarter with 354 per cent growth so i expect similar numbers for both tcs and infosys beyond tcs and infosys the situation is very company specific had seasonality in q4 so there will be some sort of headwinds in q1 has given a guidance it usually has a bad q1 hcl has made an acquisition so beyond tcs and infosys the issue is very company specific but the growth rates of other companies will be pretty low here i am talking about organic growth rates and from a margin perspective this is not a good quarter for margins you have visas you have wage hikes and other issues hitting in this quarter so you should see some pretty sharp declines at least in tcs and infosys so i am looking at 150170 bps of a margin hit in the quarter    on the brexit side which is the topic of the hour i guess this quarter per se would not see much impact because the brexit happened at the fagend of the quarter and this quarter per se should not see much of an impact but the issue is with respect to what impact these companies would have to face in the next couple of years going forward the primary impact will be in the bfsi what will be more interesting to see is also the us bfsi results which will be starting today jp morgan gives result today and it will be interesting to watch out for any visibility they offer on that part as far as i am concerned there will be near term uncertainty in it spends due to brexit and this is not just related to bfsi but it is global in nature london is a big financial centre and every company will have to keep revisiting its plans so as far as brexit is concerned i am very nervous over the near term impact in terms of uncertainty related to brexit the other big issue is the us election and the antiimmigration anti h1b noises in the us recentl one of the presidential candidates commented on the job losses in the us due to outsourcing etc so far nothing serious has happened apart from the increase in the visa cost we have not seen any blanket rejections or blanket thresholds on the number of that they will take from so there is lot of noise but i think the impact will not be very significant because of the rhetoric per se in the us immigration    i will address the margin questions first i do not think they will lower the margin guidance range but the commentary around that is something that has to be watched because they may hit a couple of quarters where the margins will trend below the lower end of the range but if you consider the full year they should be somewhere in that range so my worry is whether the range of 2628 per cent actually is quite wide and whether they will start trending towards the lower part of that range so that is the commentary that i will be closely watching out for but from a quarterly perspective again as i have said the margins will come down and they may trend slightly below 26 per cent now from a revenue perspective you are bang on that the commentary has been good and some of their poor growing areas are picking up and stuff so i do not see any issues with their revenue growth the revenue growth should be back up to 35 per cent odd levels    one has to see stock performance like this in it especially that it is an almost a truism that the growth in the it sector is coming off a bit and there are a lot of headwinds there is a big transformation going on to deliver the it services itself whether the traditional models are going to hold as a lot of automation going on there is a lot of new companies that are coming into the fray like amazon which are competing for the traditional it services increasingly some see this as an opportunity some see this as a headwind but basically there is a lot of flux going on i guess investors at some level are also worried about how this whole thing is going to play out though the companies are very convinced that this is going to open up huge for indian it companies in particular i do not think investors are very convinced and they do not have the same level of conviction as the managements when it comes to addressing this area despite the near term and reasonably strong results the worries over margins and future in the next fourfive years ahead for it continues to be an issue for investors and my view is that time has to pass maybe by the end of this year when some of the new initiatives with respect to automation platforms newer technologies start gaining scale and when the disclosure with respect to those things improves that is companies start giving number or automation platforms in fy18 and metrics like that investors will get confident about the future of the industry per se till then i guess it is a difficult time for investors to have conviction about the work in progress    i do expect them to increase the range a bit though i see infosys guidance this year as pretty strong recently their coo has commented on a weakness in one or two verticals healthcare being the primary vertical where they have flagged off some areas of concern and then the brexit happened after that my guess is given their strong guidance and creeping uncertainty in a few areas they may reduce the lower end of the guidance a bit my guess is they will expand the guidance from 115 to 135 to 1113 05 lowering of the lower end of the guidance i think they will leave it out at that at this stage and then revise it a bit more at a bit more granular level after q2

quarter of last financial year  infosys is likely to report 188 per cent yearonyear growth in revenues at rs 17046 crore compared with rs 14354 crore reported for the yearago period in dollar terms infosys is likely to report a strong sequential growth in revenue at over 4 per cent  earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation which is considered an indicator of companys financial performance rose 185 per cent in june quarter to rs 4457 crore from rs 3760 crore reported for the yearago quarter    the stock has been an underperformer since the march quarter earnings it delivered flat return sinceapril 1 compared with a nearly 10 per cent rise in the sp bse   the stock is trading above its 200 dma placed at around rs 1148 but around its 50days ema placed around rs 1192 investors holding the stock should remain invested for a nearterm target of rs 1275 say experts  despite underperformance the mediumterm trend of the stock remains bullish as it has found support around its 200day moving average a breakout above its 50day moving average and rs 1200 level is likely to fuel a further rally in the stock  if june quarter results are above expectation infosys should be able to hit rs 1200 mark on friday historically the stock has a tendency to move in an average of 100 points on either side post result announcements depending on expectations  infosys is looking strong in the space after the recent correction from its highs which made valuations slightly more attractive most analysts are betting big on infosys rather than   mediumterm to longterm investors should remain invested in the infosys stock with a stop loss below rs 1150 as technicals signal a rally in the stock which could take it towards its lifetime high of rs 1280 over the next 46 months  with around 10 per cent cut from its recent high of rs 1279 the stock is once again looking attractive as it is trading close to its 200day moving average chief strategist  technical research  trading advisory chartviewindiain told etmarketscom told etmarketscom  hence investors with a six months kind of horizon can create long positions with a stop below rs 1150 on a closing basis for a retest of lifetime highs placed around rs 1279 he said      infosys has seen buildup of long positions while tcs has seen accumulation of short positions we would recommend taking a long position in infosys call option instead of futures jain said  the options are relatively cheaper compared with the premiums in the previous quarterly results we recommend buying infosys rs 1200 call for rs 35 for a target of rs 60 and stop loss of rs 20 he said    shortterm traders can buy infosys between rs 1160 and rs 1150 with a stop of rs 1147 for an initial target placed between rs 1226 and rs 1235  however as the market sees a lot of uncertainty on result days we suggest simultaneously buying outofthemoney puts our bullish outlook shall get negated if infosys closes below its 200day ema he said    investors can go long on infosys with a target of rs 122612351254 and a stop loss of rs 1150 we maintain long position as long as infosys maintains its 200day ema at rs 1150 said singh  its recent low of rs 1153 recorded on july 8 2016 was exactly at its 200day ema placed at rs 1150  since december 2015 infosys trend has been such that its reaction has shown a good support at its 200day ema and this support due to the 200day ema has maintained the overall uptrend intact  the intermediate trend continues to remain positive and it is likely to move towards the target of rs 12261235 which is the resistance due to the gap post result if infosys moves above the gap formed in the rs 12261235 zone then it can move up to rs 1254 he said    traders can use a straddle options strategy to beat volatility buying both call and put options at strike price rs 1200 at a combined cost around rs 70 or below is recommended  a move of around 100 points in either direction is likely to bring profit from this strategy gadia said  longterm investors should remain invested in the stock and may hold it with the stop loss of rs 1150 if the stock breaches the immediate resistance level of rs 1220 then it may move till rs 1275 above which it may register a new swing high again he said

2016-07-09 13:00:00,expect infosys to find strong support at rs 1130 level manav chopra monarch networth capital,the level of rs 1130 would be an important support for infosys given an opportunity one should definitely look to buy the stock at lower levels,in a chat with manav chopra head  technical analyst monarch networth capital says that given an opportunity one should definitely look to buy stocks at lower levels    in the near term perspective it has been a week of consolidation so it is also important that the gathers some momentum before we see any further upside as long as nifty trades above 8250 which is its important support areas i think things are still fine and the shortterm trend still is fine looking at the medium term perspective we are definitely in a good upside bull market so any shortterm dips towards 8250 on the nifty should be bought into for an upside target of 8500 for bank nifty we have seen some sort of strong hurdles close to the levels of 18100 to 18150 so the banking index would have to actually break above that range decisively with volumes looking at the overall scenario and the structure the bank index is very well poised to test the levels of 18500 and 18800 in the next few weeks    if you look at the chart on weekly perspective jubiliant overall has been quite an underperformer for quite some time even though we have seen a good rally from its recent lows of rs 1000 but the stock faces stiff resistance around the levels of rs 1200 where we have actually seen the stock fall but nevertheless in the near term the stock has strong support around the 1150 to 1130 levels and i think we may not see that kind of decline because the price on the weekly charts indicates a good strong reversal formation that happened last week so 1150 levels would play a very important role for this stock going forward and in case if it manages to hold it will be time that the stock rallies and tests 1200 again    in the near term perspective infosys would be the bet that one should definitely take in also if we look at the charts for infosys on the longer time scale the stock has been on a very good uptrend and definitely in recent few weeks we have seen the stock has been an underperformer but its important support levels coincide with its longterm moving averages so i do not see much of a downside in infosys on the immediate basis  on the lower end rs 1130 would be an important support and given an opportunity one should definitely look to buy at lower levels in the medium term we expect this stock to retest its recent swing of rs 1250 to rs 1300 possibly in the next few months   i have two stock strategies my first is a buy on the stock last week did form a very strong bullish engulfing pattern which indicates a very strong support at rs 310 level  so keeping the overall strategy in place since the trend is still on the upside i think it is a good time to buy into this stock as the oscillators are still in the buy mode the stop loss can be placed at rs 305 for an upside target of rs 360  my second call is buy on tata power actually looking at the overall scenario and the structure of power index we are expecting a good trend reversal signal in the power stocks which we have seen recently and i think going forward would be one stock which would definitely see some sort of an outperformance the stock has also seen a good breakout from its monthly trend line resistance so for the near term rs 70 is an important support one can place stop loss below rs 70 for a shortterm upside target of rs 80,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/expect-infosys-to-find-strong-support-at-rs-1130-level-manav-chopra-monarch-networth-capital/articleshow/53126736.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:43:35

2016-07-01 17:00:00,brexit gives an opportunity to buy infosys on dips pankaj sharma equirus securities,irrespective of concern about it stocks there is now poosibility of buying selectively in the it space,    two reasons whatever we have seen on brexit and whatever would happen on these geographies which are very important for it companies and more importantly if you see the financials space that is a very important part of the revenue stream which it companies has and if financial companies are under stress then definitely it would be an impact on these companies that is on fundamentals and also in terms of currency translation the volatility which is there in exchange rates would definitely be very impactful for them but i think i have a word of caution here because i believe that it is still too early to say what would happen on a full year basis as we have seen in equity also in just last one week we have almost wiped off the entire losses which we have made across equity markets mostly on the day of brexit so it is too early to say and believe that this is something which will be a permanent impact but yes near term i think there is a concern and i see it is a buying opportunity on something like because i believe that it is a fundamentally solid stock available at reasonable valuation so i would be very positive on that stock and buying selectively in the it space    yes first of all it came at an interesting price and that got reflected in the subscription numbers as well i believe that it is a story which is structurally very sound we are going to see more and more of pipe gas distribution and also as we move forward as an and as a country i think there was a transition 2530 years back when the cooking gas came into picture and even the tier ii tier iii would move to that and that is something which will replicate in the next 1015 years you would see more and more cities getting into that space and that is something which will be a very strong structural tailwind for companies like mgl and also i think in terms of its valuation and financials it is a fairly reasonable bet if you want to look at something which is going to work for a couple of years i think it is an interesting name and you can probably accumulate even at some weakness when you see probably in next couple of quarters if you get that chance    i would pick because i think it has done reasonably okay in last few days and this is something which we have been highlighting for quite some time that you are at a point where this company is going to benefit from a lot of strong tailwinds which are there in the sector and its competitive positioning is also very good so overall i think that whatever we have seen in last two or three months when there were some temporary issues with the company probably would start to factor them in and believe that these kind of things happen with each and every company in a space like this so overall we are at place where the stock can do really well in the second half of cy16 i would pick that    no i think you are 100 per cent right so what happens in a case like bhel is because fundamentally i do not think anything is happening which can be called good for bhel i completely agree with you when you say that the order inflow would be in trouble because we are not really seeing any large capacity addition from most of the guys and the private sector capex is still very slow whatever capex you see in generation space is mostly happening by guys like so you are not really seeing a massive amount of order inflow that could help bhel second in terms of the pressure on margins which is also coming for them and receivables position everything is not looking very good for them unfortunately what has happened purely from a stock standpoint is when you think that what has happened in the last 12 months in the power sector that there is a lot of excitement now coming back when you look at power demand growth over the last threefour months the generation has been growing very steadily and at a rate which is definitely on the higher side also in terms of the new schemes which government has announced like uday and other things so overall people have started to look at maybe fy18 and or maybe fy19 and that is why they think that the stock would be fine but fundamentally i do not have anything different to add versus what you have said that it does not look very great for bhel  ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/brexit-gives-an-opportunity-to-buy-infosys-on-dips-pankaj-sharma-equirus-securities/articleshow/53007912.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:44:31

2016-06-18 14:00:00,it 20 after complete reboot infosys tcs could make it,what is going to happen is there is going to be big differentiation in it in the sense that infosys may make it if mr sikkas targets and goals are in any way near that,    lots of things are there housing finance for example is a whole big area we have stocks like say in consumer finance area you have equipment finance the shrirams and the sundarams of the world you now have the microfinance sector which is really in euphoric stage currently so it is just going to keep expanding and like i said today i think 30 per cent of our indices are way towards financials the composition of that will change it is not like this will become 50 per cent but it is not like 30 per cent of the market weight will go to 20 per cent either so it is the best place to stay to have a substantial chunk of your money we may have slight dissonance or disagreement today on tech our shares have got beaten up a bit unfairly because they are projecting 10 per cent growth they are in a cusp of transformation and there is reengineering happening there because with the use of ai and tools like that you would not need so many so there is a case for margin expansion which some of the ceos have alluded to  like sikka in   like akash says i can make money if my time horizon is different from the market or i find something which is not in the mainstream market these are the two big ways to make money so in the largecaps whether it is or tcs do you have a duration as frankly these are global companies now market cap is same as accenture infosys is ahead of cognizant but these four are really at the vanguard of the changes happening in the tech there is just ibm which is playing the what is in game which infosys also is trying to sort of recreate if these indeed become mainstream global companies what happens to them they would not remain where they are and they would not be priced the way we are pricing them today so there is a case for change there again like i was saying my time horizon maybe very different from the average investors and it pays to be patient in franchises like this you do not get quality companies like this very easily at the multiples they are currently at similarly in housing finance i think hdfc has suffered for years and the smaller ones have run much faster but there may be interesting things happening in that space for example listing is coming there may be asset management companies getting listed so there are interesting things happening in good companies which have become kind of boring and sort of discarded you do not have to keep reinventing wheel every time sometimes the old favourites actually do very well    that is what i am saying like in pharma it may be 5 per cent of the business today but three years from now there will be a movement when you will suddenly wake up and say oh my gosh this is so interesting like we used to say about hindustan lever in the old days and we said detergents and soaps is over then one year the market got excited on personal products and rerated the whole company and then they went into and then they got into squeezing working capital releasing cash their buyback their dividends out so a lot of things happened in a good company do you want to be in a melting icecream which is a lot of these bad companies where you want the last thing but time is your enemy whereas in a good company time is a friend in your business and why do you want to give these up so easily and surely there are worst things in the market than some of these names    i think there is not much difference but i think where i and manish agree is that this industry is going through an inflexion point in the sense that service is alluding to the old classic model  the linear model  the arbitrage linear model is changing and infosys to their credit has called this out very early what is going to happen is there is going to be big differentiation in it in the sense that infosys may make it if mr sikkas targets and goals are in any way near that  even 80 per cent of that  yes 80 per cent of that is fine    correct the only thing i would say is that everyone is not going to make that so i do not know there are like 810 large indian it services companies not all will make it but twothree will    that i am not going to get into    buy his fund    frankly i think infosys will make the cut i think that mr sikka has been very early he is a visionary on he seems to now have really charged up the organisation there is a lot of enthusiasm momentum intact in the company they have a good shot chandra clearly have an outstanding track record tcs will make it i mean the feedback we have is that they may be more quiet less vocal than infosys but not doing anything dramatically less or in no way inferior to infy these two i am pretty confident will make the cut the rest frankly i do not know i think one or two smaller companies which today we do not talk about or we do not even know will make the transition will the middle make it i do not know

2016-06-11 14:00:00,optimistic about infosys in longterm dipan mehta bse  nse,traders who had gotten into the stock have pressed the exit button but from a longterm perspective i still remain quite optimistic mehta said,  i think infosys has put the stock under cloud typically the first quarter is soft for infosys and it companies because of the reasons mentioned by the company but one should to keep in mind that infosys is great at managing investor expectations and the statements which they made recently maybe just about to curb the expectations and the projections of the investors and make them a bit more realistic all that they are saying is that the environment is tough and the going is tough at least for the first quarter or so margins are going to be under pressure volumes are going to be a bit tough so the growth which they are expecting for the next fiscal maybe more backended and that is the message which is coming through from infosys  so clearly i think the traders and short term investors who had gotten into the stock have pressed the exit button but from a longterm perspective a two threeyear kind of an outlook i still remain quite optimistic on infosys more than any of the other largecap it companies i think that they have gained some in terms of strategy and in terms of new order wins in terms of strategy they are slightly ahead of their competition you have to invest some amount in it because it has large weightage in the and the and so it is one of the preferred stocks it is just that you have to keep your expectations under control and accept that the company is not going to come out firing on all cylinders it is going to be more of a sedate but steady growth   i would like to avoid both these investment themes i think that if gst were to be a reality then there are many other companies and the economy as a whole the market as a whole will be way better off maybe fmcg companies or some of the companies which are fighting the unorganised sector like say plywood manufacturers or tile manufacturers would stand to benefit from gst considerably no doubt logistic companies also will benefit but then a lot of it has got captured in their valuation  coming to defence i think every now and then we hear about defence opening up and the huge opportunity available for domestic companies in the defence sector but that never really materialises and with the exception of and may be micro there is no other company which comes to mind which has a meaningful business coming out of defence supplies or defence sector per se  just because there is a chance of india becoming a member of the nsg i do not think the opportunity is going to be immediate it is very long term and has a very slow process having said that one would like to highlight the performance of bharat electronics the last few quarters have been excellent and the order wins and the order book position has been growing superbly for bharat electronics irrespective of the opening up of defence for private sector many opportunities seem to be opening up for the company so with usual disclosure that we have investments in bharat electronics within the defence space i think that seems to be the best bet at this point of time ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/optimistic-about-infosys-in-long-term-dipan-mehta-bse-nse/articleshow/52699987.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:46:09

2016-06-10 11:00:00,money has started shifting from other it stocks to infosys sandeep tandon quant capital,other than it money shift is also evident in largecap pharma where it is moving from sun pharma to aurobindo and divis,    vishal sikka is working at a different pace and when money shifts from one stock to another it takes its own time a lot of still have disbelief in the terms of delivery so in the last twothree years something has changed in infosys price is definitely giving that confidence if you look at it sikkas strategy has been pretty good because he comes from a product background his understanding of the us is far superior and he is pretty hands on so i think it is a very early stage that money has shifted if you recollect people were very bullish on hcl tech we were one of the few guys who were bearish on hcl because of the huge discomfort on the management related thing and people have rated very well it is a very classic example now the derating process has started money is shifting and money will shift towards infosys so whenever derating starts it takes twothree years for people to move out and sometimes when money shifts from bond to equity or one asset class to other or one stock to other it takes times so i think from that process it still has not peaked if you are looking at answer whether it is peaking out answer is no    yes i think sun pharma derating has just started look at the bharti derating that happened a few years ago and bharti still has not recovered similarly i believe the sun pharma derating has started maybe a year or two years back it is a gradual process now it is gathering momentum where people are frustrated and forced to shift from a sun or to some of the other names whether aurobindo or divis or a few other names    no i am not saying that i think it is in phases in one phase you see large index heavyweights perform maybe second phase comes and some of the midcaps will perform and with the lag effect again these names will come back so if you look at 1400015000 target for then largecaps will come back it is not like they are peaked out from trading perspective maybe consolidation is a better word so one round of big move is happening from 6800 to closer to 8500 the market can consolidate between 8500 and 8700 for a few months before you see an upmove    so from a shortterm perspective pure hedging business which is a very classic case in this earning season positive surprises were there and people were forced to cover so that sort of action we will see i think that the shortterm upmove is largely over because season is largely over now from a medium term perspective where underownership exits and some sentiments are changing those sectors or stocks will do extremely well public sectors banks could be one of the examples the way you have seen commodity prices or commodity stocks tisco or vendanta may not have peaked from a trading perspective also so from medium term perspective a telco or a are the stocks which should perform from medium term perspective from a long term perspective come the core earnings call pure fundamental calls so a infosys should do extremely well,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/money-has-started-shifting-from-other-it-stocks-to-infosys-sandeep-tandon-quant-capital/articleshow/52684190.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:46:17

consolidation there could be some more churning over the next one or two sessions if the index were to break the 8220 level which it has not been able to do there can be a good rally so i would suggest there will be consolidation for the time being between say 8160 and 8220 levels on the upside with sectors getting churned said sahil kapoor edelweiss securities the overall bias is positive i think this expiry could go and touch the 8350 level as well so the trend on the index looks bullish kapoor said while the ecb is expected to maintain status quo on policy rate it is expected to raise

2016-04-19 16:00:00,infosys is our top pick followed by hcl tech and tcs sudip bandyopadhyay market expert,the one sector which we have been bullish on for some time and we continue to remain bullish on is the twowheeler space,     after quite some time tcs did meet and kind of beat the expectations it is after six quarters they are doing that so it was a welcome surprise the guidance has been bullish and if you see really tcs has always been bullish about their guidance so i would not put too much weight into that they have traditionally been optimistic and bullish having said all this the way the scenario is panning out we will continue to maintain our focus and our interest alike in and hcl out of the it four big companies infosys will be our top pick followed by followed by tcs    you are absolutely right we have been seeing a spectacular rally it has been aided by global as well as domestic factors interest rate cut favourable monsoon forecast after a couple of years of drought like situation fiis have been bringing in money consistently on a daily basis they have been net buyers so all this has been pushing the market but we are a little worried about the results which are going to come in the near future we have seen that some of the it results have been reasonably good infosys was very good tcs kind of beat the expectations but going forward the quarterly results may not be that pleasant for the market and i would not be surprised if at some stage the profittaking starts and little bit of caution creeps into the market so we do not expect it to be a continuous rally like what we have witnessed we definitely would not be seeing something like what we saw yesterday for the next few weeks we have to be cautious and the markets will start becoming cautious overall globally sentiments are not great they are positive but not great as far as is concerned fiis continue to remain bullish we have to see how the quarterly results pan out we also have to see how actually the monsoon plays out    this sector has been beaten down mercilessly by the investors for quite some time so at some level the stocks were looking undervalued so some amount of recovery in the prices was expected the other thing is that interest rates gradually coming down will definitely help the sector also the governments policy on housing and securitisation to an extent will help certain companies like dlf so overall things are improving and we may say that for housing and the sector the worst is over it is a question now of recovery the recovery we believe will be slow and steady but the good companies which manage to clean their balance sheets when the going was bad will definitely benefit so we have been advising investors to be very careful in selecting stocks but to start investing in real estate companies    the one sector which we have been bullish on for some time and we continue to remain bullish on is the twowheeler space the entire rural demand picking up and rural gaining momentum post a good monsoon will definitely help the twowheeler sector in a big way we have been bullish on they will be the biggest beneficiary of rural demand uptick also motors if you see the scooter segment have been performing remarkably well while the others have kind of vacated that segment they went in and they kind of took a bold bet and that is paying off bajaj was having little bit of glitches here and there in the export market but the domestic performance has been improving so overall all the three listed twowheeler companies are bullish at this stage   ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-is-our-top-pick-followed-by-hcl-tech-and-tcs-sudip-bandyopadhyay-market-expert/articleshow/51894180.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:50:44

2016-04-15 16:00:00,20 bn revenue vision from 2020 is very achievable visa issue a rhetoric vishal sikka infosys,soon virtual or visa independent model wil make it irrelevant where you are working,    we have won large deals at a rather encouraging pace we won 757 million in large deals in this last quarter which is significantly higher than before when we look at the entire year we did 45 per cent more than in fy15 in large deals and why has that happened it is simply because clients feel more confident they believe in innovation they believe in the way we articulate our story the new services that we have brought in are extremely suitable for the times that are in front of us and i believe as time goes by this will only get better so are we the bellwether i really do not care but i believe that a great next generation services company is necessary for the world around us and i believe we have a shot at getting there     so 2020 is our aspiration 20 billion 30 per cent margins 80000 revenue per employee i think is very much achievable the target is still some way off but as every day goes by i feel more comfortable more confident that we can get there we do not have a concrete plan we have a guide post that we have established 165 billion from our existing services 2 billion from the new services that we are launching or that we have right now and another 15 billion through inorganic acquisition that we make between now and thenso that is a rough breakdown of the 20 billion we are looking at 115 to 135 per cent in constant currency right now for this year and obviously as time goes by we will keep revisiting that and see how we are doing  i feel very comfortable with where we are and the reason for that is it is not any particular plan or anything all these numbers are footprints of the work of 200000 people these are consequences of actions that we take and i believe that if we continue down the path that we are on we are empowering every single infoscian with technology with tools bringing the power of automation to simply their work to open up our bandwidth so that we can do more and be more and innovate with the excess bandwidth i think this can be a great company and the 2020 goal will be something that we look back in the rearview mirror as we achieve that quite comfortably     i think it is a combination of better understanding better articulation of the problem of the challenges that the clients face by engaging with design thinking with them and understanding what is it that they are really trying to do and how we might help them coming up with a better solution for that problem in all 20 million plus deals i get involved personally we have a dedicated team that looks through those and then we identify the problem and construct a great solution using all our innovations most importantly the experience the way we narrate the story the way we create that experience for the client both for the deal process itself but after the deal process have led to this improved results     no they are already done we did 1100 in q3 in last quarter q4 we freed up 1700 plus because of automation so that number is going in the right direction if you look at 80 per cent utilisation that means there is a significant unutilised population the number of 1700 is still like around a per cent of our work force so it gets lost in the 80 per cent utilisation however as time goes by over the next two three four quarters you will see that the automation number has started to become a meaningful part of productivity improvement the zero bench that we have launched in the marketplace with the excess capacity has crossed 14000 the amount of excitement that i see whenever i go and do a zero distance and zero bench meeting is unbelievable we have a team who are on our engineering bench that has actually done digital twins of things inside our own campus we have huge chillers here in these campuses they have actually built digital twins of chillers people from the bench have done that so this is an amazing utilisation it does not change operational parameters that we track but it creates a sense of tremendous inspiration and engagement in the employees that in turns results in things like better attrition and so forth so overall i am happy with where things are going and that is a great position     i would say rhetoric is the right word and i think the whole visa thing is totally irrelevant i am a us citizen we have several thousand us citizens and permanent residents working in the us along with local residents i think in the longer term there is a significant dependency that we have unnecessarily created on the whole visa thing we need to do more local hiring we have a very exciting thing we are working on called vgdm the v is virtual or visa independent global delivery model mr murthy actually started that work and it is around brining next generation collaboration technology we are taking it several steps further bringing in virtual reality and things like that to really create an experience where it does not really matter where you are you can really work in shared spaces in collaborative ways and so i think that this whole visa thing is a rhetoric i will not use something harsher than that and i do not want to talk about the drama around the election it is real enough but i do not want to say anything more to it i think they are just watching the whole spectacle itself is quite entertaining

2016-04-15 14:00:00,do not expect pricing decline to go away in the short term md ranganath infosys,i think last year we said that 2426 is our band and this year exactly we ended at midpoint 25,    i think last year we said that 2426 is our band and this year exactly we ended at midpoint 25 we continue to reiterate that band i think it is a combination of two one is of course the traditional levers that we have whether it is the utilisation the onsite roll ratio on site effort mix and the subcontractor expenses this quarter there has been some improvement on the subcontractor as well as the utilisation still long way to go on the effort mix and the onsite roll ratios we will continue to focus during the course of the year on that we do believe that those levers still there is scope for improvement having said that for the trajectory that vishal has mentioned these operational efficiency parameters alone will not be sufficient but we want to capitalise them first in the short term at the same time if you look at automation as well as the new services those components have to gradually kick in and we will continue to focus on them in fy17fy18 my sense in fy17 bulk of the improvement in the margin probably would need to come from the first bucket while we accelerate the second bucket    of course yes if you look at last couple of years margin goes theres a certain impact on the margins certainly compensation is one the exact quantum of course we will know as we progress during the quarter to answer your question yes i think that is true of the general industry at large first quarter always we have this visa fees as well as the compensation increases    i think we cannot give that at this particular point in time0    i think pricing even if you look at this financial year on yearonyear basis full year the pricing has declined by 11 in constant currency we do expect similar trend lines at least in the short term one way that you are looking at is how we counter the pricing decline through internal productivity internal efficiencies so that at tlevel still we make healthy margins when we submit a deal there is a thorough analysis in fact vishal and pravin get involved in any deal that is submitted more than 50 million it goes through a rigorous review for the entire lifecycle of the projects they review what are the productivity improvements possible onsite efforts can it come down what are the assumptions of their old ratios and so on we look at a thorough analysis of each of the deals however i think the pricing decline that we saw of 11 in constant currency we do not expect that to go away in the short term,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/do-not-expect-pricing-decline-to-go-away-in-the-short-term-md-ranganath-infosys/articleshow/51838974.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:53:15

2016-04-15 11:00:00,infosys growth aided by rupee depeciation deepak shenoy founder capital mind,infosys real growth is in the sub5 to sub7 per cent range,    i am just trying to plug in the numbers to see where the growth has been i think we are talking of profit growth trailing 12month profit growth of about 9 per cent year on year so that is just about okay though the quarter has been good i think about 1516 per cent now in terms of this quarter versus same quarter last year i think they are okay there is nothing spectacular in those numbers the revenues are a little bit higher than expected but we will have to see more colour and the details to see what has happened really     actually i do not think we have got the wow factor yet it is all going to be in the guidance and what they are talking about so prima facie the numbers are okay i do not think they are necessarily bad i always hope that infosys holds out something fantastic this time they have done okay on the profit numbers about 16 per cent yearonyear growth the itself has depreciated 61 to 63 was the range in the march quarter last year so this time it is at 66 to 69 so about 89 per cent is primarily from rupee depreciation so the real growth is largely in the sub5 per cent sub7 per cent range it is not very impressive from company growth perspective as it has been aided by the rupee depreciation     yes it seems at least now that i see the inr numbers they are at 328 per cent about 50 bps lower than they were a year back so apparently that is coming down this is also an issue that we have seen in the us as well where the financial services firms themselves are underperforming a the broad market in the stock market and their revenue growth and earnings growth have reduced substantially we are seeing large banks complain that there is not much money to be made and in the age of negative in europe and japan financial services are only going to suffer because this is not an age where they can make a lot of margin so the amount of revenue that will flow to infosys from this sector will be substantially lower i think their biggest growth is in life sciences and retail where they seem to be using their data analytics platforms or whatever they have got as internal product platforms to better effect so that sounds like an interesting play but the financial services which as you said have been the mainstay of the company for a long time may reduce in significance for the company going forward     i looked at the number of clients they have in various buckets they release this information every quarter so we are looking at fairly good gross addition of nearly 89 clients but at the one million dollar plus level they have added just three customers in total the buckets have shifted so they have added one more 100 million plus level they have increased revenue from existing clients to further levels but at the lower levels  the 1 million5 million levels they seem to have seen some attrition of customers so it may not necessarily be the largest number of deals we have seen in fact their top end the 100 200 300 million dollar deal numbers have not increased substantially in fact they have added they have no new customers of 100 million and above value this quarter so maybe these big deal wins have not happened in this quarter but i have not seen any substantial increase in the last two quarters as well so i think this might be a perception versus data issue and maybe the data is ahead of us in the sense that it may happen in the june or september quarters but right now the data is not showing that they are making a lot of large wins     if you ask me i would say wait to some of the other guys i think monday is tcs so we will have at least comparable numbers to look at but these results are okay they are not spectacular i am seeing some very positive language coming in from infosys the mood in bangalore itself says that infosys probably has changed at least what we are hearing from the industry as well so there is some positivity overall i would not just say go jump in and buy i would say still wait for other it company results and then make a decision it is just another two weeks from now you do not have to jump in on monday and you can wait a little bit ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-growth-aided-by-rupee-depeciation-deepak-shenoy-founder-capital-mind/articleshow/51837237.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:54:00

2016-04-15 12:00:00,infosys now is officially growing at a run rate higher than the industry dipen sheth hdfc securities,infosys is growing at 14 per cent which is about a good 1517 per cent higher than the industry average,    i would look at ebitda and i would look at the us revenue numbers pat is a function of how they book other income a little bit of adjustment in the last quarter on taxes and so on     so i am saying pat is not important     absolutely so the present numbers can only cause incremental damage in the story but it is the future guidance the future confidence that is going to lead to belief in the story so i think this quarter looks good if your ebitda margin of 255 per cent is anything to go by i do not know whether i have missed out the revenue number to my mind even that is important we were looking for 2466 million consolidated in usd revenues   the revenue is at rs 16550 crore   but the rupee revenue cross currency it has rupee depreciation it is near about 2 per cent qoq revenue growth in dollar terms     i think volume could be soft this quarter because the last three or four quarters they were pushing volumes aggressively and taking hits on pricing i would not mind very soft volume growth     yes so you will get tailwinds from there as well if both are combined if the pricing let off goes away a little bit and if volume does not fall you should see very good numbers     i completely agree with the prospect on that the point of view of that it is all about what they say and not what the numbers are for q4 q4 is more or less along expected lines     well we have so far baked in about rs 68 and i would be very surprised if we would not be upgrading this to close to rs 70 at least     absolutely it is growing faster than the industry it is growing faster than the industry average it has got a big weight in the it is the bellwether now for investing in india     i was drumming the table now i will begin the thumping      more certainly and not just because of that they are doing well but that they are guiding confidently and the fact that the trailing year or so at least holds solid evidence that when they are claiming a transformation is on it is indeed playing out and in fact we are in the early throws of this transformation i do not think the party has gotten over as yet obviously there are challenges digital disruptions demand environment and europe which accounts for 2324 per cent or so of revenues all that will happen but here is a company which is going to be able to attract the best possible talent which is not going to leave it in a hurry a visionary and charismatic leadership moving all the right levers aggressively shedding old skin and deadwood of the past i think 15x now looks unfair remember they have got close to rs 35000 crore of cash in the kitty they will be soon putting it to use in some way or other    i do not live for friday to friday on infosys niraj accused me of thumping the table for the last one hour i think i have been doing that for a year so but a year is the timeframe in which we have been bullish on infosys and yes we can go right we can go wrong this is one time where we have gone right i am happy we have gone right and i think we are likely to go right for at least another year    that is a tricky one because as a retail investor if you are looking for immediate gains you may not find them for the next two or three months i suspect you might end up buying it at 56 per cent higher on monday and then feel disillusioned that i missed the bus and then i got on to it at the wrong time but i think the way to invest in infosys now is to do what we at hdfc securities call a diysip if you do not mind my plugging a bit for my firm here and which is a do it yourself sip so put money into infosys every month do not look at the price put some money into infosys every month every week if you can and every day if you can just split your investing so that the market volatility and fluctuation is something that you do not bother about and it does not end up reflecting as point to point returns can be illusory unless you get the timing right you should be putting in a little bit of your money let us say if you are going to allocate 78 per cent to infosys then do that over the next seven weeks by 1 per cent per week wat is the problem with that    one year ago we were saying it is a oneyear transformation story and actually one year ago it was a oneyear transformation story which if it would play out right would be a twoyear story and which is what it has become    this stock is now going to climb that wall of disbelief is my gut feel and hence you should be getting on to the bus even now  ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-now-is-officially-growing-at-a-run-rate-higher-than-the-industry-dipen-sheth-hdfc-securities/articleshow/51837093.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:54:11

2016-04-13 12:00:00,infosys and tech mahindra are top picks kawaljeet saluja kotak institutional equities,there are multiple changes which the company has made and that should basically reflect in solid growth rate over the next four quarters,     it depends on the price of buyback and the quantum of buyback as well i mean theoretically you can say it is a floor but eventually what is the underlying rationale of buyback is it a substitute for dividend is it basically a more tax efficient cash distribution policy a lot of those details are required really before you comment on some of these factors as floor or ceiling to the stock price    in case of the expectations have been running high so i guess the focus will be both on 4q numbers as well as the guidance now what we expect the company to guide for is 11 per cent to 13 per cent growth rate in constant currency for fy2017 and for the quarter we expect 22 per cent growth in constant currency on revenues for 4q    it is achievable given the significant improvements the company has made in multiple facets of its business  whether it is the entire relationship management there whether it is a big emphasis on automation and ai or whether it is a making changes to controlling the attrition rate there are multiple changes which the company has made and that should basically reflect in solid growth rate over the next four quarters    as i said the expectations are running high ahead of the quarter so if people are looking for results day of course you cannot have a results day trade but if people are hoping that the stock goes up in the near term then you would require revenue growth guidance at 14 per cent at the upper end of the band    2020 is a good aspiration to have but a lot can change in these four years so to that extent it is good to have a longterm goal but that longterm goal has to be broken down into achievable targets so to that extent what matters is fy2017 and commentary around it    we have a positive view and our target price is rs 1300 based on september 2017 earnings we think that investors can make around 1213 per cent return in case they hold on to the stock the next 12 months    for us the top picks are infosys and     see if you are looking at quarter trades you might be right but we have a 12month horizon and in case of tech mahindra what you have is a perfect combination of low revenue growth expectations low margin expectations and the stock was at inexpensive valuations on the back of these low expectations so i am aware that the near term will be challenging but of course that is something which the street also knows and is aware of the fact is that what is not being focussed on is a very strong pipeline and a potential conversion of that pipeline into deals can change the view of the street considerably    they had an analyst meet in which they articulated how well they are doing in digital so i think that is going to be one of the major areas of emphasis in their commentary to that extent one should give them credit for it but overall on the business demand the management commentary has been quite consistent that the headwinds which they had in fy2016 would continue in fy2017 so i think that is the kind of commentary we expect from the company in terms of revenue growth expectation one should expect a modest growth from them in the quarter maybe oneandahalf per cent constant currency revenue growth rate,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-and-tech-mahindra-are-top-picks-kawaljeet-saluja-kotak-institutional-equities/articleshow/51806853.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:55:17

2016-03-26 08:00:00,infosys and upl can be good bets mitesh thacker miteshthackercom,if the nifty it or the cnx it continue to show momentum and get past 112501270 then a rally can be expected there which could lend fresh weight to the nifty index itself,     while the entire market to a certain extent looks overstretched and overbought on the intraday charts the direction is clearly on the upside the most important one could be the cnx it last time the cnx it peaked out was at levels of around 11400 which was the 200day average it is currently at about 11245 and we have closed right below that so if the nifty it or the cnx it can continue to show momentum and get past 112501270 zones then i think we are looking at some kind of a rally happening over there which could lend fresh weight or momentum to the nifty index itself i would then look at targets close to about 11580 or 11600 on the upside led by stocks like bank nifty has already had a good rally i think for the time being as long as it does not break 15680 i would maintain a positive bias but yes it is looking slightly tired out so profit booking might emerge at slightly higher levels    i am still not very comfortable trading long on the pharma side one stock which slightly appears interesting could be but then it needs to start getting past levels of 835840 to show some kind of strength also has done very well but is again looking a bit tired i think pharma on the short side still offers some interesting trades the one which i would like to trade will be dr reddys i think that is one stock which continues to show some kind of weakness and still remains in a broader range and within that range it is coming off from the upper levels it possibly could head towards rs 29502960 towards the lower end of the range so maybe that could be a good short candidate anytime it comes close to about rs 30803100 zones    i think if i was trading bank nifty i would do either a call spread or possibly a covered call where you buy the futures and sell at the money call the bank nifty looks tired to me and you would want to see some kind of intraday pullbacks to around 15750 to initiate long positions with a 100 point stop loss and a 250point kind of a target on the upside    i talked about it i think that is one preferred area infosys is a buy it is the outperforming stock in the it pack that is a buy with a stop at rs 1189 for targets close to about rs 1250 and upl also is something which traders can look afresh we have had a call earlier as well but even at current levels if somebody wants upl is a good bet with a stop at rs 447 for targets of rs 480    see a disclosure here i personally hold the stock i think you are right it was the jio news which was slightly negative and reliance had been the outperforming stock in the earlier part of the rally so i think maybe it is taking a breather with some kind of rotation coming in but overall i think the chart patterns for reliance to me on a slightly medium term basis still looks positive i would look at targets close to about rs 10501060 i think once that has been cleared then the stock can do very well and head towards 11201125 as the levels for the time being in case the stock comes down to levels close to about 10101000 rupees i think that is the best range to buy the stock with a 15point kind of a stop loss,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-and-upl-can-be-good-bets-mitesh-thacker-miteshthacker-com/articleshow/51558112.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:57:26

2016-02-22 10:00:00,infosys could easily trade in rs 1050 to rs 11501200 range deven choksey kr choksey investment managers,larger part of the funds would probably take shelter in some of the pharma names and it names and infosys would be the obvious choice,      and among the have definitely given a very clear direction about where exactly they are heading in this year as well as the coming four to six quarters so certainly one would probably keep more eye on to them visvis the entire it basket if infosys continues to give the kind of earning growth that they are basically talking about  a reduction in cost and b because of some amount of profit performance coming in from the earlier acquisitions  it would possibly start contributing to the companys performance along with some new acquisitions that they are working on so certainly i would think this could lead to some amount of improvement in the working of the company and that confidence would remain high given the fact that overall confidence in the other stocks is relatively less the larger part of the funds would probably take shelter in some of the pharma names and it names and that would include relatively less choice but of course infosys would be counted in that particular list so definitely it would keep giving support to the market and i would think that it would probably easily trade in the range of rs 1050 to rs 11501200 kind of range in which the stock is probably expected to trade going forward     all would depend on how long it takes they have suspended the production that is given but how long it is going to be in this state remains to be seen generally seen so far in this quarter you have a good take as far as the sales are concerned and given the fact that in some parts of the country you have the festive season starting in the early first quarter of 201617 i am sure the pickup in the volume and sales would be quite high now if it is going to go long then probably one would be really concerned but if this is getting settled as it seems to appear from the morning news they would be in a position to bring the production back on the track so it should not matter much at least at this point of time but once again we will have to wait for news coming in from the companys side and the auto ancillary manufactures side       well certainly in case of reliance jio launch there are two ways in which one would like to look at it they would probably expect the cover a larger coverage to happen somewhere in the second half of the calendar year but at the same time the commercial launch in a gradual manner is expected to happen in this part of the first half of the year it may not be a full launch at one go but in major cities probably we expect the launch would take place in the first quarter of the next financial year that is 20162017 it would spread across the other 22 circles where they have the tower network as well as spectrum in place so obviously it would gradually move into that direction and certainly it is expected that company is probably targeting 10 to 12 crore customers in this financial year 201617 in case of rjio that is something which one would like to see the validation of if they do end up getting 10 to 12 crores customers which are basically brought into the company with subscription based model the company would see a good amount of revenue performance on a full year basis and also beta level performance so certainly one would like to keep an eye on this particular launch we are relatively positive more because the other areas in which they are operating  the refining space and the petrochemical polymer space  where the capacity expansion is expected to play the role in coming financial year could possibly drive the profit performance or the profit growth in coming financial year so remaining relatively positive on the company here     the approach would be to stay with some of the larger banks both in psb space as well as in the private sector i have already said a lot about how exactly these bad assets could possibly be recapitalised you would start recovery from these assets eventually so to my mind it is a matter of time it is not going to happen that all bank across the board will start receiving the money at the same time but as the situation starts improving banks would be breathing much easier and that is where some of the larger sized banks would make more sense so our focus would stay with banks like sbi which has got a larger amount of abilities to recover the loan at the same time the influence on the book would be quite positive as and when they start recovering that kind of money it would be a similar situation with banks like icici in the private sector where they would have the ability to recover the larger size of money which will probably reflect on the balance sheet of the banks so keep an eye on these two aspects in a falling market they give good opportunity to add you further into the portfolio major part of the fall i believe that in banking space is already over maybe some small fall is still left who knows i think 1015 per cent more from here but the fact is that if this kind of fall comes then there could be a buying opportunity for those investors who are seeing the positives in this particular move of rbi and the banks disclosing their stressed

2016-02-25 16:00:00,on a value proposition tcs looks better than infosys sandip sabharwal asksandipsabharwalcom,people are positioning themselves in a manner where if there is some huge negative in the union budget then it could lead to some big selloff,i     it is actually very interesting i was just looking at the movement of tcs versus let us say a sbi since the early part of january and i saw that tcs is down 20 per cent odd since then and sbi is down around 25 per cent so banking is the sector that is supposed to have a lot of concerns tcs management is giving all sorts of bullish comments to that extent i do not see any reason why longterm investor should not be buying a stock like tcs today because if they believe that there is some risk in the banking sector tcs really offers not too much of a risk i think tcs at rs 2200 looks attractive infosys has held on it has not fallen in fact it has risen through the fall of the rest of the market to that extent on a value proposition tcs looks much better    equity outflows in february till yesterday were around 650 million so 650 million plus 350 million is equal to a billion dollar of outflow normally it should not create such a huge impact in the currency markets i think it is more of a sentimental impact because people are positioning themselves in a manner where if there is some huge negative in the union budget then it could lead to some big selloff and that could lead the rupee down further so my guess is that this weakness could actually reverse post budget  ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/on-a-value-proposition-tcs-looks-better-than-infosys-sandip-sabharwal-asksandipsabharwal-com/articleshow/51139558.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:59:22
2016-02-24 10:00:00,infosys britannia are my picks pankaj sharma equirus securities,infosys would be one stock where we would have a very limited downside and in couple of years we might see a 25 per cent kind of upside,    i would pick infosys and in that category i would think that as far as downside is concerned we might not have too much of a downside in infosys and if you look at the commentary which has come in just in last few days and i would probably take it with a lot credibility from the management side because what they have delivered in last 12 to 18 months is something which was definitely very good and what they are saying about the utilisation and the optimal uses of resources is something which is very positive so i believe that infosys would be one stock where we would have a very limited downside and in couple of years we might see a 25 per cent kind of upside another stock which i highlighted is britannia if you look at the correction which has happened in this name in last few weeks and at these levels i think that this is one stock where we would have not that big a problem in terms of consumption and in terms of demand and in next say about 12 to 18 months i would expect that this stock will do veryvery well and there is very limited downside for this stock so i would pick infosys and britannia in this category ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/recos/infosys-britannia-are-my-picks-pankaj-sharma-equirus-securities/articleshow/51117510.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:59:29

2016-02-11 14:00:00,infosys is a musthave stock in a largecap portfolio anand tandon,in a chat with et now anand tandon independent analyst says notwithstanding cognizant guidance indian it companies are likely to do better,    the overall picture for the still looks somewhat weak but within that if you have to look for sectors it to me looks to be one of the perhaps safest havens only because of the fact that it is beneficiary of a weaker which is what i think the rupee trajectory will continue to be besides my argument is that the bfsi sector which is one of the largest contributors for it companies in the us is not doing as badly as it was for the last several years in fact after 2008 probably that sector went into a tizzy spending money on compliance risk management and so on which kind of put some of the normal projects of developments etc on the backburner all that will change this year and therefore though the early indications are not very positive in terms of where the budgets are going to be growth will return there will be at least 1215 per cent growth for some of the front line companies in line with their guidance at least in rupee terms thus it is going to be one of the best growing sectors in the along with the fact that there are tailwinds because of currency and most of the front line companies at least have no issues and no debt while it may not perform as well as you expect in a falling market in terms of positive outflow at least it will protect your money on the other hand if the markets were to move up it will also at least track the market  as you mentioned just because cognizant has indicated that they have a problem does not mean all indian its will do badly is probably the one that has been the most aggressive in terms of changing its business model and has also put out the most bullish commentary among the front line companies i would think that that probably is a stock that is a must have in any large cap portfolio     if you were to take maruti independent of the market it has corrected enough for it to become attractive again it is broadly at around 15 times which is pretty much par for the course portfolio is good new products are likely to do good the obvious issue was that they had to push discounts in december which affected that season but that happens every year it is nothing new i think the main factor that one has to look forward to are consumer discretionaries and maruti is the key player here i would also like to see what happens to the seventh pay commission recommendations frankly if the pay commission recommendations are accepted you will find some upsides opening up beyond what the analyst estimates are if it does not come through then you may have to seek guidance but for now if you have to build a largecap portfolio maruti needs to be in that at this price  ,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/infosys-is-a-must-have-stock-in-a-largecap-portfolio-sanjay-mathur-rbs/articleshow/50940830.cms,indianstock,itimesbot,2019-03-08 23:59:48
